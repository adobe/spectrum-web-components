# Supply Chain

A workflow runs other people's code every time it `uses:` an action. Those actions execute with
your token and (on privileged triggers) your secrets, so their integrity is your integrity.

## Pin Third-Party Actions to a Commit SHA

Tags (`@v4`) and branches (`@main`) are **mutable** — the upstream owner (or anyone who compromises
them) can repoint them to new code without you changing a line. A full 40-character commit SHA is
immutable.

```yaml
# Mutable — the tag can be moved to malicious code
- uses: some-org/some-action@v3

# Pinned — this exact tree, forever
- uses: some-org/some-action@3f1e0a9c8b7d6e5f4a3b2c1d0e9f8a7b6c5d4e3f # v3.2.1
```

Rules:

- Third-party actions (anything not `actions/*` or `github/*`) → **MUST** be SHA-pinned. Flag tags
  and branches as HIGH.
- `@main` / `@master` → HIGH regardless of publisher; that is unversioned "latest".
- First-party `actions/*` → SHA-pinning is the hardened recommendation (LOW if only tag-pinned).
- Keep a trailing `# vX.Y.Z` comment so humans and Dependabot can read the intended version.

This is not theoretical: real incidents have seen popular actions' tags repointed to code that
exfiltrated secrets from every workflow that referenced the mutable tag.

## Let Dependabot Update the Pins

SHA pins go stale. Enable Dependabot for the `github-actions` ecosystem so updates arrive as
reviewable PRs (it understands the `# vX.Y.Z` comment and bumps the SHA):

```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: github-actions
    directory: /
    schedule:
      interval: weekly
```

## Artifact and Cache Poisoning

- An artifact uploaded by an untrusted `pull_request` build is **untrusted data**. A privileged
  `workflow_run` may download it, but must treat it as data only — never execute it, and validate
  paths when extracting (a crafted artifact can contain `../` path-traversal entries).
- Caches are keyed and can be populated by less-privileged runs; do not trust cached build outputs
  to be untampered in a privileged context.

## Self-Hosted Runners on Public Repos

Default (GitHub-hosted) runners are ephemeral — a fresh VM per job, destroyed after. **Self-hosted
runners persist**, so untrusted fork PR code running on one can:

- Leave behind tools/backdoors for the next job,
- Read other repositories' checkouts or credentials on the same machine,
- Pivot into your network.

Never use self-hosted runners for workflows that public forks can trigger. If you must, use
ephemeral, isolated, single-use runners and never expose secrets to fork-triggered jobs.

## `checkout` Credential Persistence

`actions/checkout` writes the token into `.git/config` by default so later `git` steps can push.
If the job subsequently runs untrusted code, that code can read the token. Set
`persist-credentials: false` when you don't need to push, especially before running build/test of
untrusted code.
