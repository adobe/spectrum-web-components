## Description

An `<sp-progress-circle>` shows the progression of a system operation such as downloading, uploading, processing, etc. in a visual way. It can represent determinate or indeterminate progress.

```
yarn add @spectrum-web-components/progress-circle
```

Import the side effectful registration of `<sp-progress-circle>` via:

```
import '@spectrum-web-components/progress-circle/sp-progress-circle.js';
```

When looking to leverage the `ProgressCircle` base class as a type and/or for extension purposes, do so via:

```
import { ProgressCircle } from '@spectrum-web-components/progress-circle';
```

## Variants

### Default

An `<sp-progress-circle>` is used to visually show the progression of a system operation such as downloading, uploading, processing, etc.

```html
<div
    style="width: 250px; height: 150px; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-around;"
>
    <sp-progress-circle
        label="A small representation of a somewhat completed action"
        progress="71"
        size="small"
    ></sp-progress-circle>
    <sp-progress-circle
        label="A medium representation of a recently started action"
        progress="22"
    ></sp-progress-circle>
    <sp-progress-circle
        label="A large representation of an almost completed action"
        progress="86"
        size="large"
    ></sp-progress-circle>
</div>
```

### Over background

When a loader needs to be placed on top of a colored background, use the over background loader as signified by `[over-background]`. This loader uses a white opaque color no matter the background. Make sure the background offers enough contrast for the loader to be legible.

```html
<div
    style="width: 250px; height: 150px; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-around;  background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.4);"
>
    <sp-progress-circle
        label="A small representation of a partially completed action"
        progress="42"
        over-background
        size="small"
    ></sp-progress-circle>
    <sp-progress-circle
        label="A medium representation of a barely started action"
        progress="7"
        over-background
    ></sp-progress-circle>
    <sp-progress-circle
        label="A large representation of a somewhat completed action"
        progress="68"
        over-background
        size="large"
    ></sp-progress-circle>
</div>
```

### Indeterminate

A progress circle can be either determinate or indeterminate as signified by `[indeterminate]`. By default, loaders are determinate. Use a determinate loader when progress can be calculated against a specific goal (e.g., downloading a file of a known size). Use an indeterminate loader when progress is happening but the time or effort to completion canâ€™t be determined (e.g., attempting to reconnect to a server).

```html
<div
    style="width: 250px; height: 150px; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-around;"
>
    <sp-progress-circle
        label="A small representation of an unclear amount of work"
        indeterminate
        size="small"
    ></sp-progress-circle>
    <sp-progress-circle
        label="A medium representation of an unclear amount of work"
        indeterminate
    ></sp-progress-circle>
    <sp-progress-circle
        label="A large representation of an unclear amount of work"
        indeterminate
        size="large"
    ></sp-progress-circle>
</div>
```

### Size

Progress Circles come in 3 sizes: small (`[size="small"]`), medium (default), or large (`[size="large"]`). These are available to fit various contexts. For example, the small loader can be used in place of an icon or in tight spaces, while the large one can be used for full-page loading.

## Accessibility

An `sp-progress-circle` element will register itself as a `role="progressbar"` element in the accessibility tree. Any value applied to the `label` attribute will be set as the `aria-label` attribute on the host. These two attributes can be used interchangably to ensure that the `sp-progress-circle` elements in your UI correctly fulfills its responsibilities to visitors of you site of all abilities.
