## Overview

An **sp-avatar** is a great way to feature a visual representation of a user.

## Example

```html
<sp-avatar label="Dog the User" src="https://placedog.net/500/500"></sp-avatar>
```

## Accessibility

The `label` attribute of the `<sp-avatar>` will be passed into the `<img>` element as the `alt` tag for use in defining a textual representation of the image displayed.
