## Overview

### Focusable

The `Focusable` subclass of `LitElement` adds some helpers method and lifecycle coverage in order to support passing focus to a container element inside of a custom element. The Focusable base class handles tabindex setting into shadowed elements automatically and is based heavily on the aybolit delegate-focus-mixin at https://github.com/web-padawan/aybolit/blob/master/packages/core/src/mixins/delegate-focus-mixin.js
