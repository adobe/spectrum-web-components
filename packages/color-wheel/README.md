## Description

An `<sp-color-wheel>` lets users visually change an individual channel of a color on a circular track.

### Usage

[![See it on NPM!](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@spectrum-web-components/color-wheel?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spectrum-web-components/color-wheel)
[![How big is this package in your project?](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/@spectrum-web-components/color-wheel?style=for-the-badge)](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=@spectrum-web-components/color-wheel)

```
yarn add @spectrum-web-components/color-wheel
```

Import the side effectful registration of `<sp-color-wheel>` via:

```
import '@spectrum-web-components/color-wheel/sp-color-wheel.js';
```

When looking to leverage the `ColorWheel` base class as a type and/or for extension purposes, do so via:

```
import { ColorWheel } from '@spectrum-web-components/color-wheel';
```

## Color Formatting

When using the color elements, use `el.color` to access the `color` property, which should manage itself in the colour format supplied. If you supply a color in `rgb()` format, `el.color` should return the color in `rgb()` format, as well.

The current color formats supported are as follows:

-   Hex3, Hex4, Hex6, Hex8
-   HSV, HSVA
-   HSL, HSLA
-   RGB, RGBA
-   Strings (eg "red", "blue")

**Please note for the following formats: HSV, HSVA, HSL, HSLA**
When setting a color's lightness or value to 100%, the hue and saturation value are not preserved. This is detailed in the [TinyColor documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ctrl/tinycolor). Currently, the Spectrum Web Components has a workaround to support the preservation of the hue.

## Example

```html
<sp-color-wheel></sp-color-wheel>
```

### Disabled

A color wheel in a disabled state shows that an input exists, but is not available in that circumstance. This can be used to maintain layout continuity and communicate that the wheel may become available later.

```html
<sp-color-wheel disabled></sp-color-wheel>
```

## Variants

### Sized

An `<sp-color-wheel>`â€™s size can be customized appropriately for its context. By default, the size is size-2400 (192 px on desktop, 240 px on mobile).

```html
<sp-color-wheel style="width: 300px; height: 300px;"></sp-color-wheel>
```
