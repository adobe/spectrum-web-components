# Header Component Development

## Requirements

### Overview

The page header appears at the top of a main page or view when a clear title, context, and page-level actions are needed (e.g., "Publish," "Edit," "Share"). It provides a consistent structure for orienting users and accessing global page functions.

This header is designed for scalability and composability. All slots and EndActions can be configured based on the needs of the page.

### Component Variants

#### L1 Header (Top-level)

- **Usage**: Top-level pages (e.g., Dashboard, Projects, Settings)
- **Features**:
    - No back button
    - Title and subtitle
    - Start and End action slots
    - Composable structure across three primary regions: Start and End

#### L2 Header (Sub-page)

- **Usage**: Subpages of parent sections and canvas pages
- **Features**:
    - Back button
    - Editable title (with edit icon when applicable)
    - No line between back button and title
    - Two rows: title row and status slots with dividers
    - Start, Middle, and End regions
    - Edit title functionality with validation

- Refer to Spacing Guidelines for padding and alignment specifications
- Scalable and composable architecture
- Consistent structure for user orientation

## Questions & Edge Cases

### Immediate Questions:

1. **Figma Reference**: Could you share the Figma link/attachment showing L1 and L2 variants?
2. **Back Button Behavior**: Should the back button trigger a custom event or handle navigation directly? - answer: it should call a callback function
3. **Edit Title Validation**: What specific validation rules should be enforced (max length, character restrictions)? – answer: use a callback to let the page handle it
4. **Overflow Strategy**: For action slots overflow, should we use a "More" menu, hide less important actions, or wrap to a new line? –  answer: use a "more" menu
5. **Theming**: Should this support both regular Spectrum and S2 (spectrum-two) themes? –  answer: support both themes

### Technical Decisions Needed:

- How should the edit title state be managed (internal state vs external control)?
- Should status slots support custom divider styling?
- How to handle responsive behavior at different breakpoints?

## Notes

- Following Accordion.ts structure and patterns
- Using Spectrum Web Components base classes
- Maintaining consistency with existing component architecture
- Focus on composability and flexibility
