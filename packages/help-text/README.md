## Overview

An `<sp-help-text>` provides either an informative description or an error message that gives more context about what a user needs to input. It's commonly used in forms.

### Usage

[![See it on NPM!](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@spectrum-web-components/help-text?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spectrum-web-components/help-text)
[![How big is this package in your project?](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/@spectrum-web-components/help-text?style=for-the-badge)](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=@spectrum-web-components/help-text)

```
yarn add @spectrum-web-components/help-text
```

Import the side effectful registration of `<sp-help-text>` via:

```
import '@spectrum-web-components/help-text/sp-help-text.js';
```

When looking to leverage the `HelpText` base class as a type and/or for extension purposes, do so via:

```
import { HelpText } from '@spectrum-web-components/help-text';
```

#### Negative

The negative variant of `<sp-help-text>` is used to convey error messages.

Help text displays either a description (the neutral variant) or an error message (the negative variant) in the same space. When a description is present and an error is triggered, it is replaced with an error message. Once the error is resolved, the help text description reappears.

Since one gets replaced by the other, the language of the help text description and the error need to work together to convey the same messaging. The description text explains the requirements or adds supplementary context for how to successfully interact with a component. The error message text tells a user how to fix the error by re-stating the interaction requirements. Make sure that the help text description and error message include the same essential information so that it isn’t lost if one replaces the other.

Communicate error messages in a human-centered way by guiding a user and showing them a solution — don’t simply state what’s wrong and then leave them guessing as to how to resolve it. Ambiguous error messages can be frustrating and even shame-inducing for users. Also, keep in mind that something that a system may deem an error may not actually be perceived as an error to a user.

For help text, usually the error is related to something that needs to be fixed for in-line validation, so a [helpful tone](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/voice-and-tone/#Tone) is most appropriate. For example, if someone were to miss filling out a required field that asks for their email address, write the error text like you’re offering a hint or a tip to help guide them to understand what needs to go in the missing field: “Enter your email address.”

```html
<sp-field-label for="negative">Password</sp-field-label>
<sp-textfield id="negative" type="password" required invalid>
    <sp-help-text slot="help-text">
        Create a password with at least 8 characters.
    </sp-help-text>
    <sp-help-text variant="negative" slot="help-text-negative">
        Passwords must be at least 8 characters
    </sp-help-text>
</sp-textfield>
```

##### Icon

When associated with content that does not supply an icon outlining the presence of an error, use the `icon` attribute to display one as part of the `<sp-help-text>` element.

```html
<sp-field-group horizontal id="fruit">
    <sp-checkbox value="apple">Apple</sp-checkbox>
    <sp-checkbox
        value="not-a-fruit"
        onchange="javascript:this.parentElement.invalid = this.checked"
    >
        Lettuce
    </sp-checkbox>
    <sp-checkbox value="strawberry" checked>Strawberry</sp-checkbox>
    <sp-help-text slot="help-text">One of these is not a fruit.</sp-help-text>
    <sp-help-text icon slot="negative-help-text" icon>
        Choose actual fruit(s).
    </sp-help-text>
</sp-field-group>
```

#### Disabled

When associated to content the is disabled, use the `disabled` attribute to match the delivery of the `<sp-help-text>` element to that content.

```html demo
<sp-field-label for="color" disabled>Color</sp-field-label>
<sp-combobox id="color" disabled>
    <sp-menu-item value="red">Red</sp-menu-item>
    <sp-menu-item value="green">Green</sp-menu-item>
    <sp-menu-item value="blue">Blue</sp-menu-item>
    <sp-help-text slot="help-text" disabled>
        Choose or add at least one color.
    </sp-help-text>
</sp-combobox>
```

### Accessibility

#### Be descriptive

Good, descriptive help text includes 1-2 short sentences of information such as:

-   An overall description of an input field or controls
-   Hints for what kind of information needs to be inputted or selected
-   Specific formatting examples or requirements

#### Ensure help text and field share the same root

It is [not currently possible](https://w3c.github.io/webcomponents-cg/#cross-root-aria) to provide accessible ARIA references between elements in different shadow roots. To ensure proper association between elements, help text must be included via the `slot="help-text"` or `slot="help-text-negative"` in an `<sp-text-field>`, `<sp-field-group>`, `<sp-combobox>` or `<sp-picker>`.

To add help text to your own custom element, see [Help Text Mixin](./help-text-mixin/).
