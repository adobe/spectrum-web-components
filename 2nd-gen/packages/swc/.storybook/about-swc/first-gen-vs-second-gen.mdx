# 1st-gen vs 2nd-gen

SWC 2nd-gen is the next version of Spectrum Web Components. It updates the design, improves the architecture, and aligns the components with Spectrum 2. This page explains how 2nd-gen is different from 1st-gen so teams know what to expect when adopting or migrating.

## Key differences

| Area              | 1st-gen SWC                                 | 2nd-gen SWC                                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Design            | Matches Spectrum 1                          | Updated for Spectrum 2 design                         |
| Architecture      | Earlier component patterns; less consistent | More consistent structure and APIs across the library |
| Tokens and scales | Based on Spectrum 1 tokens                  | Updated tokens, scales, and interaction patterns      |
| Styling system    | Older styling approach                      | Modernized styling aligned with Spectrum 2            |
| Accessibility     | Basic support                               | Improved and more complete accessibility coverage     |
| Performance       | Larger packages and more overhead           | Smaller packages and better runtime performance       |
| Long-term support | Maintained for existing products            | Recommended for all new work                          |

## What this means for teams

### If you are starting a new project

Use 2nd-gen SWC. It matches the current Spectrum guidelines and offers better performance and consistency.

### If your project already uses 1st-gen SWC

You can continue using it, but you may want to plan a migration. Some components and APIs have changed in 2nd-gen, so updates may require code changes or testing.

### If you maintain a large 1st-gen codebase

Migration will take more time. Review your components, compare APIs, and update your patterns gradually. Not everything must move at once.

## Why 2nd-gen is recommended

- It aligns with Spectrum 2, which is the standard for new Adobe work.
- Components follow more consistent design and code patterns.
- Accessibility is stronger and more complete.
- Smaller packages help improve performance.
- It better supports future updates to Spectrum.

## Where to learn more

You can find detailed guidance in the component documentation, including updated APIs, usage examples, and patterns for Spectrum 2.
If you are planning a migration, check each component’s notes for differences between 1st-gen and 2nd-gen.
