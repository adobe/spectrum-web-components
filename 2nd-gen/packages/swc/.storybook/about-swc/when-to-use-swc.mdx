# When to use SWC

Spectrum Web Components (SWC) is a good choice when you want to build interfaces that match the Spectrum design system and can run in many different environments. This page explains when SWC is the right tool and when you may need extra support or a different approach.

## Use SWC when:

### You need Spectrum-aligned UI in a web environment

SWC gives you ready-made components that follow Spectrum design and behavior. Use them when your project must look and feel like other Adobe experiences.

### You want components that work without a specific framework

SWC works in plain HTML, JavaScript, or TypeScript. It also works with frameworks like React through wrapper packages. This makes it a good option for teams using mixed technologies.

### You want consistent behavior across products

Because SWC components share a common architecture and API, they behave the same across all projects. This reduces the amount of one-off code your team needs to maintain.

### You want built-in accessibility

SWC includes accessibility features that follow Spectrum and web standards. This helps teams meet accessibility requirements without writing them from scratch.

### You only need a few components

Since SWC ships as individual packages, you can install only the components you need. This keeps your project lighter and easier to maintain.

## SWC may not be enough on its own when:

### Your project depends on framework-specific features

If your app uses advanced React, Vue, or Angular patterns, you might need extra setup or wrapper components. SWC can still work, but you may need additional engineering support.

### You need a custom design system

SWC is built to match Spectrum. If your product uses patterns that do not follow Spectrum, you may need custom components or additional styling.

### You are migrating large 1st-gen codebases

SWC 2nd-gen changes some APIs and patterns. Large migrations may require planning, refactoring, or testing before you switch fully.

## Questions to help you decide

Does your product need to follow Spectrum 2 design?
Do you want framework-agnostic components?
Will your team maintain custom UI, or should SWC handle that?
Does your project need built-in accessibility support?
Are you using only a small set of components or the full library?

If you answered “yes” to most of these, SWC is likely a good fit.

## Still not sure?

Check the examples in the component documentation or explore how other Adobe teams use SWC. You can also reach out to the SWC team if you need help deciding whether SWC is the right fit for your project.
