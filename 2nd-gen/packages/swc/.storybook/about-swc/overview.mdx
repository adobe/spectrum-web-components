# Overview

Spectrum Web Components (SWC) is Adobe’s version of the Spectrum design system using modern [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Web_Components) built with [Lit](https://lit.dev/). The 2nd-gen release updates the architecture, aligns components with [Spectrum 2](https://s2.spectrum.adobe.com/), and improves performance.

SWC gives you UI components that work in many environments. You can use them in plain HTML or JavaScript, in TypeScript, or with frameworks such as React by using wrapper packages. This flexibility makes it easier to use Spectrum across different products and teams.

This page gives you a simple overview of what SWC is and how the 2nd-gen version is different.

## What is Spectrum Web Components (SWC)?

SWC is a set of reusable UI components built with Lit. These components follow Spectrum design and interaction patterns so Adobe products can share a consistent look and feel.

Each component includes:

- Spectrum-aligned styles and behaviors
- built-in accessibility support
- a simple and consistent API
- support for any environment that uses custom elements

SWC components are published as individual packages. You can install only the components you need. You can also use SWC in React by installing the @swc-react/\* wrapper packages.

Using SWC helps teams build Spectrum-aligned interfaces without creating new code for every framework.

## What’s new in 2nd-gen SWC

The 2nd-gen version builds on the work from 1st-gen SWC. It includes updates for Spectrum 2 along with improvements that make the system more consistent and easier to maintain.

Key updates include:

- refreshed component design that matches Spectrum 2
- more consistent architecture and API patterns
- updated tokens, scales, and interaction behaviors
- better accessibility support
- smaller packages and faster performance

You can find a comparison on the 1st-gen vs 2nd-gen page.
