# Making a pull request

This document outlines our team's expectations and best practices for creating and submitting pull requests for Spectrum Web Components.

## Scoping and planning your PR

### Testing

Quality and stability are important. We require writing tests for any fixes or features you introduce. This helps ensure:

- Bugs don't resurface later.
- New features work as intended for all users.
- Overall library reliability remains high.

For 1st-gen testing guidance, see the [1st-gen README.md](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-web-components/blob/main/1st-gen/README.md). Testing guidance for 2nd-gen is forthcoming.

If you're unsure how to write tests for certain parts of the library, don't hesitate to ask maintainers for guidance. We appreciate every effort to keep the code solid!

### Documentation

In addition to well-tested code, documentation is crucial. Whenever you add or change a feature, include documentation for it in the relevant areas:

- **README.md**: Each component has a README within its directory. Ensure your changes are included here. This file is used in our generated documentation site.
- **Comment annotations**: We use comment-based documentation ([JSDocs](https://jsdoc.app/)) so that references are generated automatically where possible.

Accessible, helpful docs are a huge win for everyone, especially newcomers.

### Code formatting

We rely on automated tools like Prettier, ESLint, and Stylelint to enforce style preferences. Setting up these tools in your editor saves time and prevents minor style conflicts from slowing down reviews.

### Accessibility

Since this project is used by a diverse audience, the accessibility of our product is of utmost importance. Features will be evaluated for inclusivity by:

- The use of semantic markup.
- The appropriate [ARIA roles, properties, and states](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/) to indicate affordances that are not already indicated via semantic HTML.
- Applying [descriptive labels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/names-and-descriptions/).
- The use of the expected [keyboard navigation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/keyboard-interface/).
- Sufficient color contrast as recommended in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

If you're unsure about an accessibility detail, the [Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) ARIA Practices Guide (APG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) is a good place to start. You can also open a discussion or ask in your PR.

## Developing your PR

### Branch naming

We use a straightforward branch naming convention:

- `[username]/[short-description]` (e.g., `alex/fix-dropdown-bug`)
- If referencing a known issue, incorporate the issue number (e.g., `alex/123-fix-dropdown-bug`)

### Changeset requirements

For PRs that add or update a component, you must include a changeset to trigger the release train and update the CHANGELOG.

#### What are changesets?

Each changeset represents changes that have enough significance to warrant a new version. A changelog represents a single release. A changelog may contain several changesets.

There are three levels of releases that a changeset can describe, which are described by semantic versioning:

- **Patch** (1.0.0 → 1.0.1): Bug fixes and non-breaking changes
- **Minor** (1.0.0 → 1.1.0): New features, backwards-compatible
- **Major** (1.0.0 → 2.0.0): Breaking changes requiring user update

Each change should be categorized under one of these types:

- **Added**: New features or capabilities
- **Changed**: Changes in existing functionality
- **Deprecated**: Soon-to-be removed features
- **Removed**: Features that have been removed
- **Fixed**: Bug fixes

#### Writing changesets

Changesets are different from commit messages. **Commit messages** are used to document the changes for _contributors_. **Changesets** are used to communicate the changes to the _consumers_ of the design system.

When writing changesets:

- **Be specific and component-focused**: Reference components by their tag names, include links to the PR, and specify what changed, why, and how users should update their code (if applicable)
- **Document breaking changes**: Clearly mark breaking changes with migration guidance, listing each change on its own line
- **Focus on user impact**: Describe changes from the user's perspective, not implementation details
- **Use past tense**: Write changes in past tense to describe what has been modified

For detailed examples and best practices, see the [Writing Changesets guide](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/guides/writing-changesets/#writing-changesets).

### Conventional commits

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification to make change tracking predictable:

Format: `type(component?): subject`

The component is optional but should reference the package you are updating.

Types include:

- `feat`: New features or enhancements
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting, linting (not CSS changes)
- `chore`: Build tooling, repo management, dependency updates
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests

Examples:

- `feat(sp-card): add shadow styles for theme consistency`
- `fix(sp-action-menu): correct arrow key navigation in nested menus`
- `docs: clarify how to submit bug reports`

For breaking changes, add a `!` after the type/scope:

- `feat(sp-button)!: change API for icon placement`

## Submitting your PR

### Pull request template

When creating a pull request, you'll be presented with our template. Complete all sections to the best of your ability, including:

- Description of the changes
- Related issues (using proper [GitHub keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/using-keywords-in-issues-and-pull-requests#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) to auto-close issues i.e. `fixes`, `resolves`, or `closes`)
- Type of change in the PR title (bug fix, feature, breaking change)
- Steps you took to test your changes that reviewers can follow to also test them
- Checklist of items completed
- Screenshots/videos for visual changes

Incomplete templates may delay the review process.

### Labels for PR authors

As a PR author, you can use these labels to communicate the status of your pull request:

- `Status: Ready for review`: PR is ready for maintainer review or re-review
- `Status: WIP`: PR is still being worked on, not ready for review
- `Status: Addressing feedback`: PR owner is addressing review comments.
- `Component: [Name]`: PR affects this component

For a complete list of labels and their meanings, including reviewer-specific labels, see [Participating in PR reviews](?path=/docs/guides-contributor-guides-participating-in-pr-reviews--docs#labels-and-their-meanings).

## Specific requirements by element type

### New components

When creating or reviewing new components, ensure:

#### Documentation

#### API documentation utilizing JSDocs

- **Slots**: All slots documented in the element class docblock
- **Events**: All dispatched events documented with `@fires` docblock
- **Class fields**: All public/protected fields have proper docblocks

- **CSS custom properties**: All public CSS custom properties documented
- **CSS shadow parts**: All shadow parts documented

#### Technical requirements
