## Pull request review process

### Review timing

- Maintainers aim to review PRs in a timely manner
- If your PR hasn't received attention, feel free to ping the team in the PR comments

### Review expectations

Reviewers will check for:

- Adherence to code style and component patterns
- Proper test coverage
- Documentation completeness
- Accessibility compliance
- Visual regression test coverage
- Performance considerations

### Review etiquette

Pull requests are the start of a conversation. During the process, we aim to provide feedback that is constructive, respectful, and actionable. Suggestions will be focused on team coding standards but not on an individual's coding preferences unless there are specific considerations or risks in one approach over another.

Both reviewers and PR authors should follow these guidelines:

#### For reviewers

- **Maintain momentum**: Complete reviews in a timely manner to keep the project moving forward.
- **Provide clear, actionable feedback**: Help contributors succeed by offering specific guidance and explaining the reasoning behind suggested changes.
- **Offer solutions**: When identifying areas for improvement, suggest alternative approaches and use code suggestions to make implementation easier.
- **Seek understanding**: Ask questions to clarify intent and approach, fostering a collaborative environment for learning and improvement.
- **Recognize excellence**: Celebrate well-written code and thoughtful design decisions to encourage continued high-quality contributions.
- **Focus on impact**: Prioritize feedback on architecture, functionality, and performance to ensure the most important aspects are addressed first.
- **Focus on value**: Prioritize feedback that improves code quality and maintainability over personal style preferences. If you make a suggestion that is non-blocking feedback, prepend the comment with `nit:`.
- **Consider context**: Tailor feedback to the PR author's experience level and the scope of changes.
- **Use changes requested thoughtfully**: Reserve the Changes Requested status for instances where critical issues need to be addressed.
- **Review VRTs with care**: Thoroughly examine visual regression test results and communicate approval status to authors.

#### For PR authors

- **Self review your PR**: Take a first pass at reviewing and commenting on your own submission. This gives reviewers valuable context and may pre-emptively answer questions that might otherwise arise.
- **Resolve/respond to all comments**: Address each review comment, either with code changes or explanations of your approach.
- **Ask for clarification**: If review feedback is unclear, ask questions to understand the concern.
- **Notify when ready**: After addressing feedback, notify reviewers that the PR is ready for another look either in Slack or by requesting a new review in GitHub.
- **Explain complex changes**: For non-obvious changes, explain your reasoning in the PR description or comments.
- **Break down large PRs**: When possible, split large changes into smaller, more manageable PRs.
- **Test thoroughly**: Before requesting review, ensure your code meets the project's quality standards.

#### Resolving disagreements

- **Focus on data**: Back up opinions with data, documentation, or examples where possible.
- **Refer to standards**: Use project conventions and industry best practices to guide decisions.
- **Compromise when appropriate**: Be willing to find middle ground when opinions differ.
- **Escalate respectfully**: If consensus can't be reached, involve a third team member or technical lead for guidance.
- **Document decisions**: Record the reasoning behind significant technical decisions for future reference.

Remember that code reviews are a collaborative process aimed at improving code quality, knowledge sharing, and maintaining project standards. Approaching reviews with empathy and professionalism benefits everyone involved.
