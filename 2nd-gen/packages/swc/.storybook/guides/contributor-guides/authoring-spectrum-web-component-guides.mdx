# Authoring contributor guides

## Overview

This document provides guidance for maintainers of the Spectrum Web Components contributor guides. The contributor guides are MDX files (`.mdx`) located in the `.storybook/guides/` directory and rendered through Storybook.

## Writing & editing docs

### Creating a new doc

To create a new doc:

1. Decide where to place it within the `.storybook/guides/` directory structure
2. Create an MDX file with your content
3. Add the document to the story sort order in `preview.ts` (see [Ordering docs](#ordering-docs))

Your MDX file should contain an H1 heading representing the document title, along with whatever content you want to include:

```mdx
# Your document title

Your content goes here.

## Section one

More content...
```

### Editing existing docs

When editing existing docs, simply modify the MDX content directly. There are no auto-generated sections or special markers to work around.

### Titles and headings

- Each document should have a title, represented by a Markdown H1 (`#`) heading
- Within each document, use proper heading hierarchy (don't skip levels)
- Avoid duplicate heading names in the same document (they'll create conflicting anchor links in the table of contents)

### Links

When linking to other docs, use Storybook's path query parameter format:

```mdx
[Getting involved](?path=/docs/guides-contributor-guides-getting-involved--docs)
```

The path follows the pattern: `?path=/docs/{category}-{subcategory}-{doc-name}--docs`

## Organizing docs

### Folder structure

- Keep the hierarchy shallow when possible (avoid deeply nested structures)
- Group related content into folders within `.storybook/guides/`

### File naming conventions

- Use lowercase kebab-case for all file names: `getting-involved.mdx`, `working-in-the-swc-repo.mdx`
- No numeric prefixes are needed; ordering is controlled separately in `preview.ts`

### Ordering docs

Document order in the Storybook sidebar is controlled by the `storySort` configuration in `.storybook/preview.ts`.

To add or reorder docs, update the `order` array in the `storySort` options:

```typescript
options: {
    storySort: {
        method: 'alphabetical-by-kind',
        order: [
            'Get Started',
            'Components',
            'Guides',
            [
                'Contributor guide',
                [
                    'Getting involved',
                    'Using the issue tracker',
                    'Working in the SWC repo',
                    // Add new docs here in desired order
                ],
            ],
        ],
    },
},
```

- Documents not listed in the `order` array will appear alphabetically after explicitly ordered items
- Nested arrays represent subcategories

## Committing updates

When adding new docs, make sure to:

1. Create the MDX file with your content
2. Update the `storySort` order in `preview.ts` if you need specific positioning
3. Commit both changes together to keep the navigation in sync with content
