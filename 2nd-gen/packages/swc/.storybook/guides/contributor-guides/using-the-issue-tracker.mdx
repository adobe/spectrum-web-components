# Using the issue tracker

We use GitHub Issues for two purposes:

1. Bug Reports
2. Feature Requests (after initial discussion)

If you're having a usage issue or need support, do not open an issue. Instead, reference the Community & Support section. This helps us keep issues focused on actual bugs and actionable tasks.

## Before creating a new issue

1. Check the [Open Issues](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-web-components/issues) to see if the problem has already been reported.
    - TIP: Apply the component label to make your search process more straightforward.
2. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
3. Check if you can reproduce the problem in the latest version of Spectrum Web Components by forking a code example in [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/orgs/custom/SWC-Team/collections/spectrum-web-components).
4. If there are no related open issues and it is reproducible in isolation, then open a [Bug Report](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-web-components/issues/new?template=bug_report.yaml).

## Filing a bug report

When you file a bug, please use the `Bug Report` template provided in GitHub. Include the following information:

- A concise summary of the problem.
- Relevant components involved in the issue.
- Issue Severity based on our classifications defined below.
- What you expected vs. what actually happened, along with any errors logged in the console.
- Steps to reproduce the issue, preferably in an isolated environment, so that we can narrow down where the bug is originating from, preferably by forking an example from our [Stackblitz project](https://stackblitz.com/orgs/custom/SWC-Team/collections/spectrum-web-components). Be detailed if you write out the steps!
- Relevant environment details (OS, browser, library version).

Clear bug reports speed up the triage process, help us replicate the issue, and keep the project robust.

## Classifying issue severity

Providing the correct issue severity classification helps us adequately assess and prioritize your issue. We reserve the right to adjust the severity of your bug during triage.
Below is our issue severity classification criteria:

<sp-table size="m">
    <sp-table-head>
        <sp-table-head-cell>Severity level</sp-table-head-cell>
        <sp-table-head-cell>Description</sp-table-head-cell>
        <sp-table-head-cell>Examples</sp-table-head-cell>

            <sp-table-cell>
                A critical design or functionality issue that breaks the design
                system, causes significant usability problems, or exposes
                critical security vulnerabilities. This issue impacts all users
                and/or essential workflows, making users unable to complete any
                tasks. Requires immediate attention.
            </sp-table-cell>
            <sp-table-cell>
                Broken navigation system, complete unresponsiveness on all
                devices, components not rendering, inaccessible primary actions,
                security vulnerabilities.
                <br />
                <br />
                Accessibility: The end user is not able to complete core tasks
                or activities (e.g., key navigational elements not accessible
                via keyboard, missing or incorrect form labels that prevent
                screen reader users from completing forms or actions, critical
                color contrast issues that prevent users from reading or
                interacting with essential content).

                completing tasks or workflows.

                Content that is out of view or unreachable by customers,
                critical buttons or links not functioning, or actions that
                cannot be submitted. Unintentional breaking changes causing
                disruptions in production environments.
                <br />
                <br />

                the end user to complete core user tasks, or the end user is not
                able to complete non-core user tasks (e.g., inadequate ARIA
                labels, improper focus management, insufficient color contrast
                for non-critical elements).

## Requesting a feature or a new component

Is there something you wish the project did differently? Have a new component in mind? We love hearing new ideas and are eager to collaborate!

- Start with a discussion: Share your idea in Discussions to gather feedback and see if it aligns with project goals.
- Open a feature request issue: After some positive initial conversation, open an issue using the `Feature Request` or `New Component` template with details and potential use cases.
