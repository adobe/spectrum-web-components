# SWC Documentation Style Guide

(For 2nd-gen Storybook documentation)

This guide outlines the writing and structural standards used across the new SWC Gen-2 documentation. It ensures consistency, clarity, and alignment with Spectrum practices so designers, engineers, and contributors can all work from the same baseline.

## Update note

This style guide will evolve along with SWC and Spectrum. As patterns, terminology, or documentation needs change, update this guide to reflect new standards so the system remains consistent and easy for contributors to follow.

## 1. Writing style

- **Plain, direct language** at ~8th-grade reading level.
- **Short sentences** and minimal jargon.
- **Active voice** (e.g., “Use SWC when…”).
- **Factual and concise** explanations.
- **No marketing tone** — instructional and neutral.

## 2. Terminology

Consistent terminology helps avoid ambiguity:

- **SWC, Spectrum Web Components** → always capitalized.
- **1st-gen, 2nd-gen; Gen 1, Gen 2** → numeric, hyphenated (matches existing repo labels).
- **Components, tokens, scales, themes** → lowercase generically; capitalized for specific names (“Status light”).
- **React wrappers** → spelled exactly like this.
- **Lit** → capital “L” (brand name).
- **Spectrum 2** → written out, no hyphen.

## 3. Voice and tone

- **Helpful, factual, direct.**
- Avoid assumptions about user background.
- Use soft qualifiers when describing limitations (“may,” “can,” “might”).
- Avoid internal jargon unless technically required.
- Use examples only when they clarify decisions.

## 4. Structural conventions

### Headings

- **H1** → page title
- **H2** → major topics
- **H3** → optional subsections

### Page patterns

- **Overview page:** What SWC is, what’s new, what the documentation includes.
- **When to use SWC page:** Decision criteria (H2), optional scenarios (H3).
- **1st-gen vs. 2nd-gen page:** Comparison table + guidance sections.

### Lists

- Bulleted lists for decisions, benefits, or options.
- Numbered lists only when order matters.

### Tables

- Reserved for 1st-gen vs. 2nd-gen comparisons.
- Columns: Area, 1st-gen SWC, 2nd-gen SWC.

## 5. Links and references

- Keep link labels literal and descriptive (“Spectrum design system,” “Migration guide”).
- Avoid vague phrases like “click here.”
- Use official Adobe references only.

## 6. Accessibility

- Clear headings for screen-reader navigation.
- Avoid deep nesting in lists.
- Prefer short, scannable paragraphs.

## 7. Alignment with Spectrum style standards

This documentation follows Spectrum’s writing approach:

- **Sentence-case headings**
- **Clear conceptual separation** (overview vs. usage vs. migration)
- **Predictable patterns across all pages**
- **Terminology aligned with existing component docs and repo structure**
