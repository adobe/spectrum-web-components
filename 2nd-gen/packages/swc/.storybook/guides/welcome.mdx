# Welcome to 2nd-gen SWC

This is the Storybook for the 2nd generation (2nd-gen) of Spectrum Web Components (SWC).

## About Spectrum Web Components

Spectrum Web Components (SWC) is a library of [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Web_Components) that implements [Adobe's Spectrum design system](https://spectrum.adobe.com/).

While SWC is used primarily by Adobe product teams, it is open-sourced and available for general use.

SWC is developed by a core team in Adobe Design Engineering, but we welcome contributions from inside and outside Adobe.

## About 2nd-gen

SWC is currently in transition from its first generation (1st-gen) to its second generation (2nd-gen).

2nd-gen has two main goals:

- To provide a clean foundation for the future of SWC

- To deliver a full-fidelity Spectrum 2 implementation

2nd-gen SWC is currently in active development, with the first pre-releases expected in early 2026.

For more information on 2nd-gen plans and status, see the [CONTRIBUTOR-DOCS](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-web-components/tree/barebones/CONTRIBUTOR-DOCS/README.md) in the [SWC repository](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-web-components).

## About these Guides

Eventually, this **Guides** section will contain non-component-specific docs for 2nd-gen SWC users, replacing 1st-gen SWC's standalone [doc site](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/).
