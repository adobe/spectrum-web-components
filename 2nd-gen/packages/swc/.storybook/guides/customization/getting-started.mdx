# Getting Started

With the deprecation of `<sp-theme>`, inclusion of a new stylesheet at the application-level is required. The stylesheet contains basic document typography values, a default application background-color, and all of the relevant Spectrum 2 design data tokens as custom properties.

SWC also offers options to alter the [theme and scale contexts](/docs/guides-customization-theme-and-scales--docs).

## Include the stylesheet

{/* TODO: Help needed figuring out how to get this to export post-processing! Open to different name, ex. just `@adobe/swc/tokens.css */}

The stylesheet is available via `@adobe/swc/stylesheets/swc.css`.

Inclusion will be dependent on your application environment and build pipeline.

### Application background color

You may override the default application background color via the `--swc-application-background` custom property. Place this override after inclusion of the main stylesheet.

```css
:root {
    --swc-application-background: [your-app-color];
}
```

**Note**: It is strongly encouraged to use a Spectrum color token which has the built-in capability to adapt to light and dark theme contexts.
