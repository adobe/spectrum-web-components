# What is Spectrum Web Components (SWC)?

Spectrum Web Components (SWC) is a collection of framework-agnostic UI components built with [Lit](https://lit.dev/) and designed to implement the [Spectrum design system](https://spectrum.adobe.com/). Each component provides:

- Spectrum-aligned styling and interactions
- built-in accessibility support
- a consistent, lightweight API
- integration with any web application or framework that supports custom elements

SWC components are published as bundle. They work in plain HTML/JavaScript, TypeScript, or alongside frameworks such as React (using wrappers).

SWC enables teams to build applications that follow Spectrum’s visual and interaction patterns without needing a framework-specific implementation.
