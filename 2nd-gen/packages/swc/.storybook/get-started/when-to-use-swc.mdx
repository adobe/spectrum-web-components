# When to use SWC?

Use SWC when you need:

- Spectrum-aligned components in a web application
- a framework-agnostic solution that works across multiple environments
- consistent UI and behavior across Adobe surfaces
- lightweight components with strong accessibility and built-in testing patterns

SWC is a good fit for:

- new projects that use web components
- shared or cross-product experiences
- applications that must stay framework-independent
- teams migrating from framework-specific components to a more flexible approach

If your project already relies heavily on React, Vue, or another framework-specific implementation of Spectrum, choose the version that best fits your architecture. SWC remains the recommended option for platform-wide, framework-agnostic solutions.
