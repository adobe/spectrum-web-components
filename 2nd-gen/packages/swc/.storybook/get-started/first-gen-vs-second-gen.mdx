# First Gen vs Second Gen

Spectrum Web Components (SWC) originally launched with a 1st generation of components aligned to Spectrum 1. While the first generation also has limited foundational support of Spectrum 2, it will never be able to achieve full Spectrum 2 fidelity. The 2nd generation updates this implementation to fully support Spectrum 2, modernizes the architecture, and improves long-term maintainability.

Improvements in 2nd-gen SWC:

- Updated design, tokens, and interaction patterns based on Spectrum 2
- More consistent component APIs
- Improved performance in rendering and updates
- Better test coverage and accessibility support
- A clearer documentation structure with predictable templates

What stays the same:

- Components continue to be framework-agnostic
- Lit remains the underlying technology
- Components are still delivered as individual packages

Migration notes:

Some 1st-gen components have direct 2nd-gen replacements. Others will be added over time. Check individual component pages for migration guidance and compatibility notes where available.
