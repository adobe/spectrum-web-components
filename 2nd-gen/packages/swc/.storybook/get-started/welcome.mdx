# Welcome to the next generation of Spectrum Web Components (2nd-gen SWC)

Spectrum Web Components (SWC) is Adobe’s implementation of the Spectrum design system using modern [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Web_Components). The 2nd generation of SWC introduces a more consistent architecture, updated component design aligned with [Spectrum 2](https://s2.spectrum.adobe.com/), and improved performance across the library.

This site provides everything you need to get started, use components in your project, and contribute to the platform.

You’ll find:

- introductory information about the SWC platform
- documentation for each component
- platform-wide accessibility and style guidance
- contributor workflows and development tools

Use these resources to adopt 2nd-gen SWC in new projects or migrate from earlier versions.
