# Accessibility

The `<sp-divider>` element implements the following accessibility features:

- **ARIA role**: Automatically sets `role="separator"` to ensure proper semantic meaning for assistive technologies
- **Orientation support**: When `vertical` is true, automatically sets `aria-orientation="vertical"` to indicate the divider's orientation

#### Best practices

- Medium or large dividers can be used with header text to visually create a section or page title. Place the divider below the header for best results.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast when using `static-color` variants on colored backgrounds.
- Use dividers to create meaningful visual separation, not just decorative lines.
- Use dividers sparingly; excessive use can diminish their visual impact.
