# Spectrum Web Components

This is the monorepo for Spectrum Web Components (SWC), a library of [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) implementing Adobe's [Spectrum design system](https://spectrum.adobe.com/).

While SWC is used primarily by Adobe product teams, it is open-sourced and available for general use.

SWC is developed by a core team in Adobe Design Engineering, but we welcome contributions from inside and outside Adobe.

See [CONTRIBUTOR-DOCS](./CONTRIBUTOR-DOCS/README.md) to learn more about the project, the repository, and how you can contribute.
