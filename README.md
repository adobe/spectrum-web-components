# spectrum-web-components

Spectrum Web Components is a future-looking project to develop Adobe Spectrum design language based around web components, ES-Modules, and modern browser standards.

It will not support older browsers and will only target modern ever-green browsers that fully implement the Custom Elements V1 specification, e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari. Polyfills will be avoided as much as possible.

# Requirements

-   NodeJS >= 8.10.0
-   Typescript
-   Browsers with Custom Elements V1 and Shadow DOM support, e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari.

# Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-web-components.git
cd spectrum-web-components
yarn
```

# Documentation

The Spectrum Web Components documentation site is available via the following command:

```bash
yarn docs:start
```

By default the resulting site will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

# Storybook

You can run [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) through the command:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

By default the resulting site will be available at [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006).

## Linting

The project will be linted on a pre-commit hook, but you can also run the lint suite with `npm run lint`. It uses ESLint to lint the JS / TS files, and StyleLint to lint the CSS files.

## Testing

Tests are implemented using the Karma test runner with Chai, Mocha and Sinon frameworks. These tests can be executed with:

```
yarn test
```

During development you may wish to use `npm run test:watch` to automatically build and re-run the test suites.

## Benchmarking

You can acquire current runtimes for the individual elements with:

```
yarn build:tests
yarn test:bench
```

This will run the defined [Tachometer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tachometer) tests and report the current runtime cost of each individual element. When not making changes to the benchmarks thy have been built on your local machine, you can stip `npm run build:tests` for later passes.

## Anatomy of a Component

There is extended documentation on adding a new component to the library in the [documentation site](http://localhost:8080/guides/adding-component). However, at a high level, you will be building the following structure:

-   packages
    -   new-component-name
        -   src
            -   index.ts
            -   new-component-name.css
            -   new-component-name.ts
            -   spectrum-config.js
            -   spectrum-new-component-name.css
        -   stories
            -   new-component-name.stories.ts
        -   test
            -   benchmark
                -   test-basic.ts
            -   new-component-name.test.ts
        -   package.json
        -   README.md
        -   tsconfig.json

## Development within Adobe

Due to the internal `@adobe` npm registry served by Artifactory, when developing this module internally it is necessary to provide an `.npmrc` local to this project which forces the use of the public `@adobe` scope on public npm. Therefore if you are an Adobe employee working on this project add the following to a `.npmrc` file in this folder:

```
@adobe:registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

This will ensure that when installing dependencies you do not accidentally pull from the internal repositories.

## IDE Notes

The build process compiles `.css` files using PostCSS and wraps them in the `lit-html` `css` template tag and writes out a `.css.ts` file for easy import into TypeScript files. This file should not be edited, and is ignored by `.gitignore`, but you may also wish to hide the files in your IDE.
