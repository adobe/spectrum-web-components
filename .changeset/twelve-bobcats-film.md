'@spectrum-web-components/infield-button': patch

📝 [#3536](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-css/pull/3536) Thanks [@marissahuysentruyt](https://github.com/marissahuysentruyt)!

-   Adjusts the background-color of the infield button components within stepper to use gray-100 as opposed to gray-25.
-   This corresponds to the background-color updates picker has for S2.
-   Corrects the border color for the default picker for S2 foundations, using gray-500 (instead of gray-800) to align with other field/form components.
