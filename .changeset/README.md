# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

## What are Changesets?

Changesets are a way to manage versions and changelogs for monorepos. Each changeset:

- Describes changes made in one or more packages
- Indicates the type of change (major, minor, patch)
- Contains a brief markdown summary of the changes

## How to Add a Changeset

1. Make your changes to the codebase
2. Run the following command:
    ```bash
    yarn changeset
    ```
3. Follow the prompts:
    - Select the packages that have changed
    - Choose the type of change for each package:
        - `major` (breaking changes)
        - `minor` (new features)
        - `patch` (bug fixes)
    - Write a summary of the changes

The command will create a new markdown file in the `.changeset` directory with your changes.

## Important: @spectrum-web-components/core and component updates

When making changes to `@spectrum-web-components/core`, you **must** also include the corresponding `@spectrum-web-components` component in the same changeset to ensure the changes appear in the component's changelog. This is because `@spectrum-web-components/core` changes are internal and don't automatically propagate to the component changelogs.

**Best practice**: Create a single changeset that includes both packages when updating core functionality that affects a specific component.

## Example Changeset

A typical changeset file looks like this:

```markdown
---
'@spectrum-web-components/core': patch
'@spectrum-web-components/button': minor
'@spectrum-web-components/theme': patch
---

- **Added**: Added new variant `tertiary` to `<sp-button>` component [#9999](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-web-components/pull/9999)
- **Fixed**: Fixed `<sp-theme>` theme compatibility issues [#10000](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-web-components/pull/10000)
```

## Publishing Process

1. Changesets are collected in PRs
2. When PRs are merged, the changesets are accumulated
3. During release, changesets are used to:
    - Determine new version numbers
    - Generate changelogs
    - Update package.json files
