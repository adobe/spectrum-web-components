Updates the picker button component from version 6.0.0-s2-foundations.16 to 6.1.2. The update should bring the background colors for the picker button in line with S2-foundations design specs:

default state: `gray-50` to `gray-100`
hover state: `gray-100` to `gray-200`
key-focus state: `gray-100` to `gray-200`
