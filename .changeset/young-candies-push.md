**Added**: Added `level` property to `<sp-accordion-item>` to allow customization of the semantic heading level (1-6) used for accordion item titles. The property defaults to `3`, maintaining backward compatibility with existing implementations.

This change enables developers to maintain proper document structure and accessibility by matching accordion heading levels to their page's heading hierarchy.
