'@spectrum-web-components/textfield': patch

The changes included resolve UI issues with number-field by proxy of textfield. The validation icons in number-field no longer overlap the infield buttons. The width of the number-field now now calculates accurately and is modifiable via the `--mod-stepper-width` token as it was before.
