'@spectrum-web-components/number-field': patch
---

The changes included resolve UI issues with number-field by proxy of textfield. The validation icons in number-field no longer overlap the infield buttons. The width of the number-field now calculates accurately and can be modified via `--mod-stepper-width` token as it was before.
