# Text formatting conventions

## Capitalization rules

- Use sentence case for all headings and section titles (capitalize first word only)
  - Correct: "Getting started with components"
  - Incorrect: "Getting Started With Components"
- Exceptions: Proper nouns, acronyms, and technical terms should maintain their standard capitalization (e.g., JavaScript, CSS, HTML, GitHub)
- Never use all caps except for:
  - Established acronyms (e.g., API, HTML, CSS)
  - Severity levels (e.g., SEV1, SEV2)

## Markdown formatting

- Use backticks (`) for:
  - Code snippets
  - File names
  - Component names
  - Technical terms
- Use bold (**) for:
  - Section headers in structured content
  - Important terms on first use
  - UI element names
- Use italics (*) sparingly, only for:
  - Term definitions
  - Emphasis in technical explanations

## Lists and bullets

- Start each bullet point with a capital letter
- End each bullet point consistently (either all with periods or all without)
- Use parallel structure in lists (all items should be same grammatical form)

## Technical writing style

- Use present tense
- Use active voice
- Be concise and direct
- Avoid jargon unless technically necessary
- Define abbreviations on first use
