# Jira ticket guidelines

When prompted to create a Jira ticket, output the following:

- Title
- Labels
- Severity
- Description

Output results in the chat window in a way that can be copied and pasted into Jira.

## Jira syntax formatting rules

Use these syntax rules when writing Jira tickets:

- `h2.` through `h6.` - Headings (use `h2.` for main, `h3.` for secondary, etc. - avoid `h1.` in descriptions)
- `{*}{*}` - Bold text
- `{code}{code}` - Inline code
- `{code:language}{code}` - Language-specific code blocks
- `[text|url]` - Links
- ` - ` - Bullet points
- `#` - Numbered list items

## Title format

- Use the format: `[Component] Brief description of change or issue`
- Keep titles concise but descriptive (under 80 characters)
- Use present tense for the description (e.g., "Add" not "Added")

## Description structure

- Present title, labels, and severity before description content
- Include links to GitHub pull requests or RFCs when applicable (prompt if not provided)
- All tickets must include acceptance criteria
- Provide enough context so anyone can understand the objective
- Use prefixes in titles: [Bug], [Fix], [Docs], [Refactor], [Research], [S2], [Test]

Examples:

- [Bug(component)]:
- [bug]:
- [Fix(component)]:
- [fix]:
- [Docs(component)]:
- [docs]:
- [Documentation]:
- [Refactor(component)]:
- [Research(component)]:
- [discovery]:
- [RFC(component)]:
- [S2 Foundations]:
- [S2]:
- [Test(component)]:

## More specific templates

### General Jira ticket template

```
h2. Acceptance criteria
(how we ensure that the work is complete)

h2. Overview
(plain language explaining the ticket)

h2. Technical notes/resources
(any technical notes/links/etc)

h2. QA
(steps someone will use to be sure that the work fulfills the ticket's request and that everything's working properly)

h2. Design specs
(are there any design specs/files/mock-ups we can include here? Any other design notes?)
```

### Bug reporting template

```
{*}Link to original issue:{*} (Add a link to the original issue in GitHub if applicable)

h2. Expected behavior
(Description of what the user would expect to happen)

h2. Actual behavior
(The actual behavior observed by the user)

h2. Screenshots
(Screenshots of the problem if applicable)

h2. How can we reproduce the issue?

# Go to '...'
# Click on '....'
# Scroll to '....'
# Check console
# See error

h2. Sample code or abstract reproduction which illustrates the problem
(are there any design specs/files/mock-ups we can include here? Any other design notes?)

h2. Severity
(The severity of the issue according to the [documentation|https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-web-components/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#issue-severity-classification])
```

### RFC or feature ticket template

This ticket template is for tracking work for RFCs, new features, new components, or research tickets. This template is not a substitute for the deliverable itself; rather, it's setting expectations for what the deliverable might look like and gives a high-level overview of the problem being tackled so that others can understand what is being worked on.

Items with an asterisk are optional depending on the context.

```
h2. Link to original issue
(Add a link to the original issue in GitHub if applicable)

h2. Overview
(The problem you're looking to explore solutions for or do research on)

h2. Acceptance criteria
(What is the desired outcome of this RFC or research process? What would make this ticket "done"? What follow-up work would be required? Refer to the RFC guide for examples.)

h2. Estimated internal impact
(If implemented, what impact would this work have on other APIs, other components, the project structure, or team initiatives? Refer to the impact diagram for details.)

h2. Estimated external impact
(If implemented, what impact would this work have on consumers or downstream/upstream dependencies?)

h2. Anticipated reviewing audience
(Who would you like to provide feedback on your RFC/research? Your immediate team, your partners, or a wider consumer audience? What are their roles?)

h2. Proposed solutions
(Pseudocode or short description that outlines what the solution might look like. You may not have any solutions yet.)

h2. Supplementary documentation
(Has this feature or component been implemented in existing design specs or in another project? Share those here to paint a bigger picture of the end result. For architectural changes, have you seen this done in other libraries? Are there any tools you're looking at trying out to solve your problem?)

h2. Additional context
(Add any other context, drafts, etc. if you have them)
```

## Severity classification

- SEV1: Critical - System down, data loss, security breach
- SEV2: High - Major feature broken, significant user impact
- SEV3: Medium - Feature partially broken, moderate impact
- SEV4: Low - Minor issues, minimal user impact
- SEV5: Trivial - Cosmetic issues, no functional impact

## Best practices

- Link to relevant GitHub issues or pull requests using the format: `GH-{number}`
- Include component name in brackets if applicable: `[sp-button]`
- Add relevant labels for easier filtering
- Attach screenshots or videos for visual changes
- Reference design specs or documentation when available

## Acceptance criteria

- Write criteria in "Given/When/Then" format
- Make criteria specific and testable
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
- Consider accessibility requirements

## Labels

Use the following labels to categorize tickets appropriately:

- `a11y`: Accessibility-related issues and improvements
- `API`: Changes to component APIs or interfaces
- `docs`: Documentation updates or docs site changes
- `engineering-processes`: Engineering workflow and process improvements
- `feature`: New feature implementations
- `hold`: Tickets temporarily suspended or blocked
- `i18n`: Internationalization and localization work
- `iOS`: iOS-specific issues and bugs
- `mobile`: Mobile platform issues and responsive design
- `necromancy`: Backlog tickets older than 2 years requiring revival
- `product-processes`: Process improvements for product team collaboration
- `refactor`: Code restructuring and refactoring work
- `research`: Tasks requiring investigation or research
- `RFC`: Request for Comments documentation
- `s2foundations`: Spectrum 2 Foundations related work
- `spectrum2`: Spectrum 2 platform specific tasks
- `team-processes`: Internal team workflow improvements
- `test`: Test implementation or testing infrastructure work
- `triage`: New tickets requiring team assessment and prioritization
- `VoiceOver`: VoiceOver screen reader specific issues

## Issue type

Jira includes the following issue types:

- Bug: For something in the code that needs to be fixed.
- Epic: For tickets that are larger than 8 story points and need to be broken up into multiple issues.
- Story: For tickets that tie to code deliverables. Whether that's research, an RFC, or a pull request, it counts! If you don't know what your issue type should be, this is a safe bet.
- Task: For work that doesn't relate to a code deliverable.
