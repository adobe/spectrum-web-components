# Jira ticket guidelines

When prompted to create a Jira ticket, output the following:

- Title
- Labels
- Severity
- Description

Output results in the chat window in a way that can be copied and pasted into Jira.

## Jira syntax quick reference

Based on [official Jira documentation](https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/WikiRendererHelpAction.jspa?section=all).

**Essential formatting:**

- `h2.` for section headings (avoid `h1.` in descriptions)
- `{*}text{*}` for bold text
- `{code}text{code}` for inline code
- `{code:language}code block{code}` for code blocks with syntax highlighting
- `[text|url]` for links
- `- ` for bullet points (dash + space) <!-- markdownlint-disable MD038 -->
- `# ` for numbered list items (hash + space) <!-- markdownlint-disable MD038 -->
- `{color:red}text{color}` for colored text
- `{quote}text{quote}` for block quotes
- `||heading||` for table headers, `|cell|` for table data

**Critical rules for ticket descriptions:**

- ❌ **Don't** use `##` for sub-items (renders as heading, not nested list)
- ❌ **Don't** try to nest bullets under numbered items  
- ❌ **Don't** mix list types on the same line
- ✅ **Do** keep QA checklists flat (one item per line)
- ✅ **Do** add details inline with dashes or parentheses
- ✅ **Do** use `h2.` for all main sections

**List formatting example:**

```jira
# First step - additional context here
# Second step with inline details
# Third step (include expected result)
```

## Title format

- Use the format: `[Component] Brief description of change or issue`
- Keep titles concise but descriptive (under 80 characters)
- Use present tense for the description (e.g., "Add" not "Added")

## Description structure

- Present title, labels, and severity before description content
- Include links to GitHub pull requests or RFCs when applicable (prompt if not provided)
- All tickets must include acceptance criteria
- Provide enough context so anyone can understand the objective
- Use prefixes in titles: [Bug], [Fix], [Docs], [Refactor], [Research], [S2], [Test]

Examples:

- [Bug(component)]:
- [bug]:
- [Fix(component)]:
- [fix]:
- [Docs(component)]:
- [docs]:
- [Documentation]:
- [Refactor(component)]:
- [Research(component)]:
- [discovery]:
- [RFC(component)]:
- [S2 Foundations]:
- [S2]:
- [Test(component)]:

## Choosing the right template

Use this decision tree to select the appropriate template:

**Bug reporting template** - Use when:

- Reporting unexpected behavior or errors
- Something is broken or not working as designed
- You can provide reproduction steps

**RFC or feature ticket template** - Use when:

- Proposing new features or components
- Requesting architectural changes
- Conducting research or discovery work
- Creating design proposals

**General ticket template** - Use when:

- Making documentation updates
- Performing refactoring work
- Making chore or maintenance changes
- Improving tests or CI/CD
- The work doesn't fit other categories

## More specific templates

### General Jira ticket template

```jira
h2. Acceptance criteria
(how we ensure that the work is complete)

h2. Overview
(plain language explaining the ticket)

h2. Technical notes/resources
(any technical notes/links/etc)

h2. QA
(checklist steps someone will use to be sure that the work fulfills the ticket's request and that everything's working properly)

h2. Design specs
(are there any design specs/files/mock-ups we can include here? Any other design notes?)
```

### Bug reporting template

```jira
{*}Link to original issue:{*} (Add a link to the original issue in GitHub if applicable)

h2. Expected behavior
(Description of what the user would expect to happen)

h2. Actual behavior
(The actual behavior observed by the user)

h2. Screenshots
(Screenshots of the problem if applicable)

h2. How can we reproduce the issue?

# Go to '...'
# Click on '....'
# Scroll to '....'
# Check console
# See error

h2. Sample code or abstract reproduction which illustrates the problem
(are there any design specs/files/mock-ups we can include here? Any other design notes?)

h2. Severity
(The severity of the issue according to the [documentation|https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-web-components/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#issue-severity-classification])
```

### RFC or feature ticket template

This ticket template is for tracking work for RFCs, new features, new components, or research tickets. This template is not a substitute for the deliverable itself; rather, it's setting expectations for what the deliverable might look like and gives a high-level overview of the problem being tackled so that others can understand what is being worked on.

Items with an asterisk are optional depending on the context.

```jira
h2. Link to original issue
(Add a link to the original issue in GitHub if applicable)

h2. Overview
(The problem you're looking to explore solutions for or do research on)

h2. Acceptance criteria
(What is the desired outcome of this RFC or research process? What would make this ticket "done"? What follow-up work would be required? Refer to the RFC guide for examples.)

h2. Estimated internal impact
(If implemented, what impact would this work have on other APIs, other components, the project structure, or team initiatives? Refer to the impact diagram for details.)

h2. Estimated external impact
(If implemented, what impact would this work have on consumers or downstream/upstream dependencies?)

h2. Anticipated reviewing audience
(Who would you like to provide feedback on your RFC/research? Your immediate team, your partners, or a wider consumer audience? What are their roles?)

h2. Proposed solutions
(Pseudocode or short description that outlines what the solution might look like. You may not have any solutions yet.)

h2. Supplementary documentation
(Has this feature or component been implemented in existing design specs or in another project? Share those here to paint a bigger picture of the end result. For architectural changes, have you seen this done in other libraries? Are there any tools you're looking at trying out to solve your problem?)

h2. Additional context
(Add any other context, drafts, etc. if you have them)
```

## Severity classification

Use this guide to determine the appropriate severity level:

**SEV1 (Critical)** - Immediate action required:

- Production system is down
- Data loss or corruption
- Security vulnerability or breach
- Complete feature failure affecting all users

**SEV2 (High)** - Action required within 24-48 hours:

- Major feature is broken for most users
- Significant performance degradation
- Workaround exists but is impractical
- Blocking progress on dependent work

**SEV3 (Medium)** - Action required within 1-2 weeks:

- Feature partially broken or unreliable
- Affects subset of users
- Reasonable workaround available
- Non-critical functionality impaired

**SEV4 (Low)** - Action required within a month:

- Minor bugs with minimal impact
- Edge case issues
- Nice-to-have improvements
- Non-blocking technical debt

**SEV5 (Trivial)** - No urgency:

- Cosmetic issues only
- Documentation typos
- Code formatting
- Optional optimizations

## Best practices

- Link to GitHub using plain text format: `GitHub Issue #123` or full URLs
- Include component name in brackets: `[sp-button]`
- Add relevant labels for filtering
- Attach screenshots for visual changes
- Write acceptance criteria in testable format
- Reference design specs when available
- Do NOT use Jira's smart links for GitHub (Adobe policy)

## QA checklist guidelines

- Use simple numbered list format (`# item`)
- Start with action verbs (Verify, Test, Check, Confirm, Navigate, Click)
- Keep items concise and verifiable
- Add details inline with dashes or parentheses
- Aim for 5-10 checklist items
- Keep lists flat (no sub-items using `##`)

**Example:**

```jira
h2. QA

# Create a test PR and verify the workflow runs successfully
# Navigate to the PR comments and verify it includes all three preview URLs
# Click each preview URL and confirm correct content loads
# Test search functionality in the documentation preview
# Verify smoke tests pass in workflow logs
```

## Common mistakes to avoid

❌ **Vague titles**: "Fix bug" → ✅ "[Button] Fix focus ring in high contrast mode"

❌ **Missing context**: "This doesn't work" → ✅ "Hover state fails when disabled in dark theme"

❌ **Implementation in title**: "Change line 45 to useEffect" → ✅ "[Button] Fix memory leak when unmounting"

❌ **Multiple changes**: "Update docs, fix bug, refactor" → ✅ Separate tickets for each

❌ **Implementation-focused criteria**: "Add handleClick function" → ✅ "When clicked, dialog closes and form resets"

❌ **Incomplete QA steps**: "Click button" → ✅ "Click button and verify modal opens with correct content"

## Labels

Use the following labels to categorize tickets appropriately:

- `a11y`: Accessibility-related issues and improvements
- `API`: Changes to component APIs or interfaces
- `docs`: Documentation updates or docs site changes
- `engineering-processes`: Engineering workflow and process improvements
- `feature`: New feature implementations
- `hold`: Tickets temporarily suspended or blocked
- `i18n`: Internationalization and localization work
- `iOS`: iOS-specific issues and bugs
- `mobile`: Mobile platform issues and responsive design
- `necromancy`: Backlog tickets older than 2 years requiring revival
- `product-processes`: Process improvements for product team collaboration
- `refactor`: Code restructuring and refactoring work
- `research`: Tasks requiring investigation or research
- `RFC`: Request for Comments documentation
- `s2foundations`: Spectrum 2 Foundations related work
- `spectrum2`: Spectrum 2 platform specific tasks
- `team-processes`: Internal team workflow improvements
- `test`: Test implementation or testing infrastructure work
- `triage`: New tickets requiring team assessment and prioritization
- `VoiceOver`: VoiceOver screen reader specific issues

## Issue type

Jira includes the following issue types:

- Bug: For something in the code that needs to be fixed.
- Epic: For tickets that are larger than 8 story points and need to be broken up into multiple issues.
- Story: For tickets that tie to code deliverables. Whether that's research, an RFC, or a pull request, it counts! If you don't know what your issue type should be, this is a safe bet.
- Task: For work that doesn't relate to a code deliverable.

## Complete ticket examples

### Example 1: Bug ticket

**Title:** [Picker] Keyboard navigation fails in Safari when menu contains icons

**Labels:** bug, a11y, Browser: Safari, SEV3

**Severity:** SEV3

**Issue Type:** Bug

---

```jira
{*}Link to original issue:{*} GitHub Issue #1234

h2. Expected behavior

When using arrow keys to navigate the Picker menu in Safari, focus should move between menu items regardless of whether they contain icons.

h2. Actual behavior

Arrow key navigation stops working after the first icon-containing menu item. Focus becomes trapped and further keyboard input is ignored.

h2. How can we reproduce the issue?

# Open Safari browser (version 16.0+)
# Navigate to the Picker component page in Storybook
# Open the "With Icons" example
# Click the Picker to open the menu
# Press the down arrow key repeatedly
# Observe that focus stops after the second item

h2. Screenshots

[Attach screenshot showing focus stuck on second menu item]

h2. Sample code

{code:html}
<sp-picker>
  <sp-menu-item>Option 1</sp-menu-item>
  <sp-menu-item><sp-icon-checkmark></sp-icon-checkmark> Option 2</sp-menu-item>
  <sp-menu-item><sp-icon-star></sp-icon-star> Option 3</sp-menu-item>
</sp-picker>
{code}

h2. Severity

SEV3 - Affects keyboard users on Safari, but mouse/touch users unaffected. Workaround: use Chrome or Firefox.
```
