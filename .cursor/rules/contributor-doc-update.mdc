# Contributor docs navigation and link validation

## When to apply this rule

Recognize and apply this rule when the user requests any of the following:
- Update contributor docs navigation
- Update nav / TOC / breadcrumbs in contributor docs
- Regenerate contributor docs
- Validate/verify links in contributor docs
- Fix broken links in contributor docs
- Any mention of "CONTRIBUTOR-DOCS" or "contributor docs" with "update", "nav", "links", or "verify"

## Instructions location

**Primary path:** `CONTRIBUTOR-DOCS/01_contributor-guides/07_authoring-contributor-docs/01_ai-agent-instructions.md`

## What to do

1. **Verify the instructions file exists** at the path above
   - If the file exists, read it and follow the instructions for "Role 1: Operator"
   - If the file does NOT exist, see "Self-correction procedure" below

2. **Follow the AI agent instructions** to:
   - Run the nav update script (which automatically validates links)
   - Handle any broken links that are reported
   - Report results to the user

## Self-correction procedure

If the instructions file is not found at the expected path:

1. Search for the file using: `glob_file_search` with pattern `**/ai-agent-instructions.md`
2. Filter results to find the one in `CONTRIBUTOR-DOCS/` folder
3. Read the found file to confirm it contains the nav update instructions
4. **Update this rule file** with the new path by modifying the "Primary path" line above
5. Inform the user that you've updated the rule with the new location
6. Continue with the nav update process

## Quick reference

The nav update process typically involves:
- Running a Node.js script in the authoring-contributor-docs folder
- The script automatically updates breadcrumbs, TOC, and validates all links
- If broken links are found, fix straightforward issues automatically
- Only consult the user for ambiguous cases

Execution time is typically 20-200ms for the entire CONTRIBUTOR-DOCS tree.
