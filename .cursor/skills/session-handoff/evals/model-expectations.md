# Model-Specific Expectations

This document describes expected behavior differences across Claude models when using the session-handoff skill.

## Model Characteristics

### Haiku (Fast, Lightweight)

- **Strengths**: Quick responses, follows explicit instructions well
- **Limitations**: May need more guidance, less proactive
- **Skill adjustments**: May need more explicit prompts for complex scenarios

### Sonnet (Balanced)

- **Strengths**: Good balance of speed and capability, handles workflows well
- **Limitations**: May occasionally miss subtle triggers
- **Skill adjustments**: Should work well with default instructions

### Opus (Most Capable)

- **Strengths**: Excellent context understanding, proactive suggestions
- **Limitations**: May over-elaborate when not needed
- **Skill adjustments**: May add extra context/suggestions beyond requirements

## Expected Behaviors by Scenario

### Scenario 1: Basic Handoff Creation

| Aspect              | Haiku              | Sonnet                    | Opus                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Trigger recognition | Should trigger     | Should trigger            | Should trigger         |
| Script execution    | Runs script        | Runs script               | Runs script            |
| TODO completion     | May need prompting | Fills reasonable defaults | Rich, detailed content |
| Validation reminder | May skip           | Usually includes          | Always includes        |

**Haiku-specific guidance:**

- May need explicit "now fill in the TODO sections"
- Keep prompts simple and direct

**Opus-specific notes:**

- May proactively suggest additional sections
- May add extra context without being asked

### Scenario 2: Handoff Chaining

| Aspect                  | Haiku                | Sonnet            | Opus               |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Finds previous handoffs | With explicit prompt | Usually automatic | Always automatic   |
| Uses --continues-from   | May need reminder    | Usually correct   | Always correct     |
| Context from previous   | Basic reference      | Good summary      | Detailed synthesis |

**Haiku-specific guidance:**

- Explicitly mention "link to the previous handoff"
- May need to specify exact filename

### Scenario 3: Resume from Handoff

| Aspect             | Haiku             | Sonnet        | Opus               |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Lists handoffs     | With prompt       | Automatic     | Automatic          |
| Staleness check    | May skip          | Usually runs  | Always runs        |
| Context absorption | Basic             | Good          | Excellent          |
| Next steps focus   | May need guidance | Usually clear | Proactive planning |

**Haiku-specific guidance:**

- Explicitly ask "check the staleness first"
- May need "what are the next steps from the handoff?"

### Scenario 4: Proactive Handoff Suggestion

| Aspect                      | Haiku                   | Sonnet               | Opus            |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- | --------------- |
| Recognizes substantial work | Unlikely without prompt | Sometimes            | Usually         |
| Suggests handoff            | Rarely proactive        | Sometimes proactive  | Often proactive |
| Timing of suggestion        | N/A                     | After 5+ major items | After 3-5 items |

**Notes:**

- Haiku will rarely proactively suggest handoffs
- Sonnet may suggest after explicit substantial work description
- Opus most likely to suggest unprompted

### Scenario 5: Validation Flow

| Aspect                 | Haiku                 | Sonnet            | Opus             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Runs validation script | With explicit request | Usually automatic | Always automatic |
| Interprets score       | Basic                 | Good              | Detailed         |
| Actionable feedback    | May need prompting    | Usually provides  | Detailed plan    |

### Scenario 6: Staleness Check

| Aspect                | Haiku                 | Sonnet         | Opus              |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| Runs staleness script | With explicit request | Usually        | Always            |
| Interprets results    | Basic                 | Good           | Detailed analysis |
| Recommendations       | Repeats script output | Contextualizes | Strategic advice  |

### Scenario 7: Secret Detection

| Aspect               | Haiku         | Sonnet      | Opus                         |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| Detects secrets      | Via script    | Via script  | Via script + may notice more |
| Warning clarity      | Basic         | Clear       | Detailed security advice     |
| Remediation guidance | Script output | Clear steps | Comprehensive plan           |

## Tuning Recommendations

### For Haiku Optimization

If Haiku struggles:

1. Add more explicit trigger phrases to description
2. Include step-by-step numbered instructions
3. Add explicit checkpoints ("After creating, run validation")
4. Reduce ambiguity in instructions

### For Sonnet Optimization

If Sonnet misses triggers:

1. Ensure key terms are in description
2. Add example trigger phrases
3. Make workflow decision points clearer

### For Opus Optimization

If Opus over-elaborates:

1. Add "keep responses concise" guidance
2. Specify when NOT to add extra content
3. Define clear scope boundaries

## Pass/Fail Criteria by Model

### Minimum Pass Thresholds

| Model  | Min Score   | Notes                                |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Haiku  | 49/70 (70%) | Allow some missed proactive triggers |
| Sonnet | 56/70 (80%) | Should handle most scenarios well    |
| Opus   | 63/70 (90%) | Should excel at all scenarios        |

### Critical Failures (Any Model)

These should always work regardless of model:

- [ ] Basic handoff creation with explicit request
- [ ] Script execution when instructed
- [ ] Secret detection warning
- [ ] File creation in correct location

## Testing Protocol

1. **Run setup script:**

    ```bash
    python evals/setup_test_env.py
    cd /tmp/handoff-eval-project
    ```

2. **Test each scenario in new conversation**
    - Start fresh conversation for each scenario
    - Use exact trigger phrases from test-scenarios.md
    - Record scores using results template

3. **Compare across models**
    - Note significant behavior differences
    - Identify skill improvements needed
    - Update SKILL.md if Haiku needs more guidance

4. **Document findings**
    - Use results template for each model
    - Note specific failure modes
    - Recommend skill adjustments
