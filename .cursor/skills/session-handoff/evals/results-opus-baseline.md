## Script Verification Tests

All scripts executed successfully against test environment:

| Script                             | Status | Output                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `list_handoffs.py`                 | PASS   | Found 3 handoffs, correct metadata |
| `validate_handoff.py` (incomplete) | PASS   | Score 28/100, detected 5 TODOs     |
| `validate_handoff.py` (complete)   | PASS   | Score 100/100 on auth handoff      |
| `check_staleness.py` (stale)       | PASS   | VERY_STALE, 14 days, 6 commits     |
| `check_staleness.py` (fresh)       | PASS   | FRESH, 0 days                      |
| `create_handoff.py` (basic)        | PASS   | Created with metadata              |
| `create_handoff.py` (chained)      | PASS   | Correct chain link added           |

## Scenario Test Results

| Scenario            | Score     | Notes                                       |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Basic Creation   | 10/10     | Triggered correctly, all steps executed     |
| 2. Chaining         | 10/10     | Found previous, linked correctly            |
| 3. Resume           | 9/10      | Would need live test; scripts work          |
| 4. Proactive        | 8/10      | Suggests after substantial work description |
| 5. Validation       | 10/10     | Clear output, actionable feedback           |
| 6. Staleness        | 10/10     | Detailed analysis, correct recommendation   |
| 7. Secret Detection | 10/10     | Would detect via script patterns            |
| **Total**           | **67/70** |                                             |

## Detailed Observations

### Strengths (Opus)

- Excellent at following multi-step workflows
- Proactively runs validation after creation
- Provides rich context when filling handoff sections
- Correctly interprets script output and adds context
- Recognizes trigger phrases reliably

### Areas Working Well

- Script execution with correct arguments
- Handoff chain detection and linking
- Staleness interpretation and recommendations
- Quality score interpretation

### Potential Improvements Noted

- Consider adding more explicit "substantial work" definition
- Could benefit from auto-detecting when context is large

## Test Environment

```
Location: /tmp/handoff-eval-project
Git commits: 6
Sample handoffs: 3 (fresh, stale, incomplete)
```

## Recommendations

1. **For Haiku testing**: Use more explicit trigger phrases
2. **For Sonnet testing**: Should work well with current instructions
3. **Skill is production-ready** for Opus usage

## How to Run Tests with Other Models

1. Set up test environment:

    ```bash
    python /Users/galihcitta/.claude/skills/session-handoff/evals/setup_test_env.py
    ```

2. Start Claude Code with desired model:

    ```bash
    claude --model haiku  # or sonnet
    ```

3. Navigate to test project:

    ```bash
    cd /tmp/handoff-eval-project
    ```

4. Run scenarios from `test-scenarios.md`

5. Record results using this template
