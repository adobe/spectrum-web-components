# Evaluation Test Scenarios

Test these scenarios across Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus to verify skill effectiveness.

## Test Setup

Before running tests:

1. Create a test project directory with some files
2. Initialize git repository
3. Make some commits
4. Have the skill available

```bash
# Setup test environment
mkdir -p /tmp/handoff-test-project/src
cd /tmp/handoff-test-project
git init
echo "console.log('hello');" > src/index.js
echo "# Test Project" > README.md
git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit"
echo "function test() {}" >> src/index.js
git add . && git commit -m "Add test function"
```

## Scenario 1: Basic Handoff Creation

**Trigger phrase:** "create a handoff"

**User prompt:**

```
I've been working on implementing user authentication. I modified src/auth.js
to add JWT token validation and updated the middleware. Create a handoff so
I can continue later.
```

**Expected behavior:**

- [ ] Skill triggers (recognizes "create a handoff")
- [ ] Runs `create_handoff.py` script
- [ ] Creates file in `.cursor/handoffs/`
- [ ] Pre-fills metadata (timestamp, project path, git branch)
- [ ] Prompts user to complete TODO sections
- [ ] Mentions validation step

**Model-specific expectations:**
| Model | Expectation |
|-------|-------------|
| Haiku | Should follow script instructions literally, may need prompting for details |
| Sonnet | Should execute workflow smoothly, fill in reasonable context |
| Opus | Should proactively add rich context, may suggest improvements |

---

## Scenario 2: Handoff with Chaining

**Trigger phrase:** "continue from previous handoff"

**Setup:** First create a handoff using Scenario 1, then:

**User prompt:**

```
I'm continuing the auth work from yesterday. Create a new handoff that
links to the previous one.
```

**Expected behavior:**

- [ ] Lists existing handoffs
- [ ] Uses `--continues-from` flag
- [ ] Adds "Handoff Chain" section with link
- [ ] References previous handoff context

---

## Scenario 3: Resume from Handoff

**Trigger phrase:** "resume from handoff" or "load handoff"

**Setup:** Have an existing handoff file

**User prompt:**

```
I want to continue where I left off. Load my last handoff.
```

**Expected behavior:**

- [ ] Runs `list_handoffs.py` to find handoffs
- [ ] Runs `check_staleness.py` on selected handoff
- [ ] Reports staleness level
- [ ] Reads handoff document
- [ ] Summarizes "Immediate Next Steps"
- [ ] Follows resume checklist

---

## Scenario 4: Proactive Handoff Suggestion

**Trigger:** After substantial work (no explicit request)

**Setup:** Simulate a long session by describing significant work done

**User prompt:**

```
Great, we've now:
1. Refactored the database connection pooling
2. Fixed the N+1 query in UserService
3. Added caching layer with Redis
4. Updated all the tests
5. Fixed 3 TypeScript errors

What's next?
```

**Expected behavior:**

- [ ] Recognizes substantial work done (5+ items)
- [ ] Proactively suggests creating a handoff
- [ ] Uses the suggested phrasing from SKILL.md

---

## Scenario 5: Validation Flow

**Trigger phrase:** "validate the handoff"

**Setup:** Create a handoff with incomplete sections

**User prompt:**

```
I created a handoff but I'm not sure if it's complete. Can you validate it?
```

**Expected behavior:**

- [ ] Runs `validate_handoff.py`
- [ ] Reports quality score
- [ ] Lists missing/incomplete sections
- [ ] Warns about any secrets detected
- [ ] Provides actionable next steps

---

## Scenario 6: Staleness Check

**Trigger phrase:** "check if handoff is still valid"

**Setup:** Have an older handoff with several commits since

**User prompt:**

```
I have a handoff from last week. Is it still relevant or should I
create a new one?
```

**Expected behavior:**

- [ ] Runs `check_staleness.py`
- [ ] Reports staleness level (FRESH/SLIGHTLY_STALE/STALE/VERY_STALE)
- [ ] Lists specific issues (days old, commits since, etc.)
- [ ] Provides recommendation

---

## Scenario 7: Secret Detection

**Trigger:** During handoff creation with sensitive content

**User prompt:**

```
Create a handoff. Note that I configured the API with key sk-abc123xyz
and the database password is "supersecret".
```

**Expected behavior:**

- [ ] Creates handoff
- [ ] Runs validation
- [ ] Detects potential secrets
- [ ] Warns user about security risk
- [ ] Recommends removing sensitive data

## Scoring Rubric

For each scenario, score:

| Criterion          | Points | Description                       |
| ------------------ | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| Triggers correctly | 2      | Skill activates on trigger phrase |
| Follows workflow   | 3      | Executes steps in correct order   |
| Uses scripts       | 2      | Runs appropriate Python scripts   |
| Output quality     | 2      | Produces useful, accurate output  |
| Error handling     | 1      | Handles edge cases gracefully     |
| **Total**          | **10** | Per scenario                      |

**Pass threshold:** 7/10 per scenario
