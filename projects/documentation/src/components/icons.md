## Description

The `<sp-icons-medium>` and `<sp-icons-large>` elements that are included in this package supply your application with the Spectrum CSS Icons at both the medium and large sizes for use via the `<sp-icon>` element also provided by the Spectrum Web Components library. Include at least one of these elements in a project that makes use of icons in these sets, but feel free to include these sets in the scope of any element that leverages them as they will be deduplicated as appropriate to ensure all of your components are able to deliver the icons included therein.

### Installation

```
npm install @spectrum-web-components/icons

# or

yarn add @spectrum-web-components/icons
```
