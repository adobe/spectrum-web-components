# example-project

This example project shows a use of the `spectrum-web-components` package with webpack. It is a minimal example that only includes the files necessary to show a primary and secondary button on a page.

# Usage

First install with `npm run install` then start the build and run the web server with `npm run serve`. This will build the production version of the example app and serve it via `http-server`. Inspect the webpack bundle report in the `report` folder to see the resultant bundle sizes.
