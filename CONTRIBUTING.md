## Did you find a bug?

### Before Submitting A Bug Report

-   Check the [Issue Discussions](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-web-components/issues).
-   You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself. Most importantly, check if you can reproduce the problem [in the latest version of Spectrum Web Components](https://studio.webcomponents.dev/workspace/adobe).

-   Perform a [search](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-web-components/issues) to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

### Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-web-components/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-web-components/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Create an issue on the repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-web-components/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yaml).

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

-   Suggest your change in the [ideas list](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-web-components/discussions/categories/ideas) and start writing code.

-   Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. You can start on [Adding your idea here](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-web-components/discussions/categories/ideas) under Ideas

-   Once your Idea or request is submitted, you can create an [issue](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-web-components/issues/new/choose) with the New Component or a Feature Request template.

## Branching Strategy

### Branch Naming Convention:

-   Use `[username]/[issue]` format for branches.
-   `[username]` identifies the contributor.
-   `[issue]` refers to the associated issue or feature number.

For e.g: Be descriptive after the /, like `john-doe/123-fix-bug`.

## Create your first Pull Request

-   After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing.

## Git Commit Messages

### Commitlint

Please be sure that you take this into concideration when submitting PRs to this repositiory. Generally, your commits should look like the following:

```bash
type(scope?): subject #scope is optional, but should reference the package you are updating
