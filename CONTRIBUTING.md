## Community & support

A fantastic first step to contributing is filing an issue. This is where you can:

-   Ask questions, file bugs, and troubleshoot with other users.
-   Propose new features and ideas or get feedback on your own through a linked pull request.
-   Additionally, you can check GitHub Discussions to stay up-to-date with any major announcements about the project.

### External contributors

**Adobe Employees, read Internal contributors section below.**
If you need support or have a question about how something works, filing an issue is the best place to start. A team member will be in touch to either triage your issue or follow-up with you in the comments.

### Internal contributors

If you work for Adobe, our Slack channel #spectrum_web_components has some great workflows to get you started. Be sure to read the Welcome Canvas when you join.

## How you can contribute

There's a common misconception that you need to code in order to contribute. In reality, there are many different ways to help:

-   Filing well-structured bug reports that show what's broken and how to reproduce it.
-   Suggesting new features that improve the current design system.
-   Improving our documentation to make it clearer for the next person.
-   Reviewing pull requests from other community members and sharing feedback.
-   Helping other users on GitHub Discussions.
-   Advocating for the project on social media or at meetups.

Of course, contributing code is also welcome from fixing a bug to building a brand-new component. All types of contributions help keep Spectrum Web Components thriving.

---

## Contributor license agreement

We require all external contributors to sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA). If you haven't signed it before making your first contribution, please do soâ€”otherwise, we can't merge your changes.

---

## Code of conduct

Spectrum Web Components abides by the Adobe Code of Conduct. By participating, you agree to treat all community members kindly and respectfully. We're committed to fostering a welcoming, inclusive environment.
Should any behavior fall short of these expectations, please report it to <Grp-opensourceoffice@adobe.com>.

---

## Using the issue tracker

We use GitHub Issues for two purposes:

1. Bug Reports
2. Feature Requests (after initial discussion)

If you're having a usage issue or need support, do not open an issue. Instead, reference the Community & Support section. This helps us keep issues focused on actual bugs and actionable tasks.

### Before submitting a bug report

1. Check the [Open Issues](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-web-components/issues) to see if the problem has already been reported.
    - TIP: Apply the component label to make your search process more straightforward.
2. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
3. Check if you can reproduce the problem in the latest version of Spectrum Web Components.
4. If there are no related open issues and it is reproducible in isolation, then open a [Bug Report](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-web-components/issues/new?template=bug_report.yaml).

---

## Bug reports

When you file a bug, please use the `Bug Report` template provided in GitHub. Include the following information:

-   A concise summary of the problem.
-   Relevant components involved in the issue.
-   Issue Severity based on our classifications defined below.
-   What you expected vs. what actually happened, along with any errors logged in the console.
-   Steps to reproduce the issue, preferably in an isolated environment, so that we can narrow down where the bug is originating from. (e.g., webcomponents.dev or CodePen). Be detailed if you write out the steps!
-   Relevant environment details (OS, browser, library version).

Clear bug reports speed up the triage process, help us replicate the issue, and keep the project robust.

### Issue severity classification

Providing the correct issue severity classification helps us adequately assess and prioritize your issue. We reserve the right to adjust the severity of your bug during triage.
Below is our issue severity classification criteria:

| Severity level | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Examples                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Feature requests/new component

Is there something you wish the project did differently? Have a new component in mind? We love hearing new ideas and are eager to collaborate!

-   Start with a discussion: Share your idea in Discussions to gather feedback and see if it aligns with project goals.
-   Open a feature request issue: After some positive initial conversation, open an issue using the `Feature Request` or `New Component` template with details and potential use cases.

---

## Pull requests

If you plan to fix a bug, create a feature, or improve documentation, follow the [Pull Request Guide](PULL_REQUESTS.md) to ensure you're contribution meets expectations for getting reviewed.

---

## Branches

We keep things organized with a branch naming strategy:

-   `[username]/[short-description]` (e.g., `alex/fix-dropdown-bug`) is often all you need.
-   If your work references a known issue, you could also incorporate the issue number (e.g., `alex/123-bug-fix`).

Avoid editing distribution files (if present). Make changes to the source files, then allow the build system to generate any bundled or output files automatically.

---

## Developing locally

Read the steps outlined in the [README.md](README.md) to get your environment set up.

If you encounter hurdles, feel free to ask for help in your pull request or in the community forum.

---

## Testing

Quality and stability are important. We require writing tests for any fixes or features you introduce. This helps ensure:

-   Bugs don't resurface later.
-   New features work as intended for all users.
-   Overall library reliability remains high.

Read about our testing guidance in the [README.md](README.md).

If you're unsure how to write tests for certain parts of the library, don't hesitate to ask maintainers for guidance. We appreciate every effort to keep the code solid!

---

## Documentation

In addition to well-tested code, documentation is crucial. Whenever you add or change a feature,include documentation for it in the relevant areas:

-   **README.md**: Each component has a README within its directory. Ensure your changes are included here. This file is used in our generated documentation site.
-   **Comment annotations**: We use comment-based documentation ([JSDocs](https://jsdoc.app/)) so that references are generated automatically where possible.

Accessible, helpful docs are a huge win for everyone, especially newcomers.

---

## Best practices & guidelines

### Code formatting

We rely on automated tools like Prettier, ESLint, and Stylelint to enforce style preferences. Setting up these tools in your editor saves time and prevents minor style conflicts from slowing down reviews.

### Accessibility

Since this project is used by a diverse audience, the accessibility of our product is of utmost importance. Features will be evaluated for inclusivity by:

-   The use of semantic markup.
-   Labeled interactive elements with appropriate accordance's.
-   Accounting for appropriate states, such as focus and keyboard navigation, according to [standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/keyboard/).

If you're unsure about an accessibility detail, the [Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) ARIA Practices Guide (APG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) is a good place to start. You can also open a discussion or ask in your PR.

### Commit guidelines

As mentioned previously, we use [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) syntax:

    type(component?): subject
    //component is optional, but should reference the package you are updating

Examples:

-   `feat(sp-card): add shadow styles for theme consistency`
-   `fix(sp-action-menu): correct arrow key navigation in nested menus`
-   `docs: clarify how to submit bug reports`

This helps us track changes in a predictable way and automate versioning.
