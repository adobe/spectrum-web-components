## Welcome

Welcome! We're excited you're interested in improving Spectrum Web Components. Whether you're reporting bugs, adding new features, writing documentation, or helping other users, your contributions make this project better for everyone.

Here you'll find a broad overview of how you can get involved. Please read through these guidelines to help keep the contribution process smooth and to ensure we're all on the same page.

## Community & support

A fantastic first step to contributing is filing an issue. This is where you can:

- Ask questions, file bugs, and troubleshoot with other users.
- Propose new features and ideas or get feedback on your own through a linked pull request.
- Additionally, you can check GitHub Discussions to stay up-to-date with any major announcements about the project.

### External contributors

**Adobe Employees, read Internal contributors section below.**
If you need support or have a question about how something works, filing an issue is the best place to start. A team member will be in touch to either triage your issue or follow-up with you in the comments.

### Internal contributors

If you work for Adobe, our Slack channel #spectrum_web_components has some great workflows to get you started. Be sure to read the Welcome Canvas when you join.

## How you can contribute

There's a common misconception that you need to code in order to contribute. In reality, there are many different ways to help:

- Filing well-structured bug reports that show what's broken and how to reproduce it.
- Suggesting new features that improve the current design system.
- Improving our documentation to make it clearer for the next person.
- Reviewing pull requests from other community members and sharing feedback.
- Helping other users on GitHub Discussions.
- Advocating for the project on social media or at meetups.

Of course, contributing code is also welcome from fixing a bug to building a brand-new component. All types of contributions help keep Spectrum Web Components thriving.
