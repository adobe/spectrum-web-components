<!-- Document content (editable) -->

This section contains strategic planning documentation for the Spectrum Web Components project, including objectives, workstreams, component roadmaps, and milestones.

The documentation here helps us:

- Understand the strategic context and goals driving our work
- Track progress across multiple workstreams
- Coordinate efforts that span multiple components
- Monitor individual component roadmaps and status
- Define and track project milestones

## Contents

- **[Objectives and Strategy](./01_objectives-and-strategy.md)** - Strategic context for the 1st-gen-to-2nd-gen transition, including our goals and approach.

- **[Workstreams](./02_workstreams/README.md)** - Detailed information about our active workstreams, offering a workstream-centric view of cross-cutting work affecting many or all components.

- **[Components](./03_components/README.md)** - Component-specific planning and status information, offering a component-centric view of how individual components are affected by multiple workstreams.

- **[Milestones](./04_milestones/README.md)** - Information about project milestones and their goals.

Together, these views help us manage the project roadmap, ensuring we make progress on strategic objectives while maintaining clarity about the state and evolution of individual components.
