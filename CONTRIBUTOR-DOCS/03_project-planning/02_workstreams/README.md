## About workstreams

Workstreams represent our strategic objectives translated into actionable work. Each workstream defines a coherent body of work toward a specific goal, with its own scope, approach, and priorities.

This section of the contributor docs contains detailed information about each of our active workstreams.

For more on how Workstreams (this section) and [Components](../03_components/README.md) provide complementary views of our work, see the [Project Planning overview](../README.md).
