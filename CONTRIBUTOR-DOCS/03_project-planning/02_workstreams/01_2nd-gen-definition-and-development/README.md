# 2nd-gen Definition and Development

<!-- Document content (editable) -->

Building the 2nd-gen project from the ground up as a clean foundation for future work. This workstream encompasses multiple parallel efforts:

- Developing the rendering layer and component architecture
- Implementing tooling, infrastructure, and build improvements
- Setting up tests, Storybook, and documentation
- Improving code quality and developer experience

Most work toward Unification, building a clean foundation for future work, and landing full-fidelity Spectrum 2 flows into this workstream.
