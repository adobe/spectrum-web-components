3. **Optimize Performance**: Streamline modal behavior and state management
4. **Modern Dialog Patterns**: Use native dialog element where appropriate

#### Priority 2 (Medium Impact)

1. **Enhance Accessibility**: Add missing navigation and mobile patterns
2. **Improve API**: Standardize dialog and action API design
3. **Add Advanced Features**: Auto-focus and enhanced keyboard navigation
4. **Better Testing**: Simplify testing patterns for modal behavior
