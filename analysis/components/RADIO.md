## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Form API Research**: Study modern form constraint capabilities
2. **Navigation Analysis**: Analyze current keyboard navigation complexity
3. **Usage Audit**: Understand common radio group configurations
4. **Accessibility Audit**: Comprehensive a11y testing

### Long-term Strategy

1. **Simplify Architecture**: Two-component system with clear separation
2. **Modern APIs**: Use modern form validation and constraint APIs
3. **Performance Focus**: Lightweight implementation
4. **Mobile Excellence**: Touch-first design patterns
5. **Simple API**: Focus on common use cases with intuitive configuration

This component has excellent foundational patterns and accessibility but needs simplification to reduce complexity and improve performance while maintaining its solid form integration and group navigation.
