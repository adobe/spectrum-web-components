# Spectrum 2 Modernization: Executive Summary & Recommendation

## üéØ Executive Summary

After comprehensive analysis of the current Spectrum Web Components codebase and infrastructure, we recommend **creating a new GitHub repository** for Spectrum 2 development. This approach provides the optimal balance of development velocity, risk mitigation, and coexistence capabilities while addressing critical technical debt and accessibility gaps.

## üìä Key Findings

### Current State Analysis

- **67 components** with varying complexity and accessibility gaps
- **9 tools** with significant technical debt and performance issues
- **Testing infrastructure** critically outdated (2+ major versions behind)
- **No bundling strategy** limiting performance optimization
- **Complex interdependencies** creating maintenance challenges

### Critical Issues Identified

1. **Accessibility Gaps**: Inconsistent ARIA implementation, missing keyboard patterns
2. **Infrastructure Debt**: Outdated testing tools with manual patches
3. **Performance Limitations**: No bundle optimization, source-based builds
4. **Complexity Debt**: Overly complex tool patterns affecting maintainability

## üèÜ Recommended Strategy: New Repository
