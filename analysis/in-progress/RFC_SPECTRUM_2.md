# RFC: Spectrum 2 Design System Modernization

**Status**: Draft  
**Authors**: Engineering Team  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Version**: 1.0

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Our design team has completely rebuilt Spectrum from the ground up in Figma to be fully accessible and responsive with correct DOM structure. We need to build Spectrum 2 while maintaining Spectrum 1 coexistence and modernizing our infrastructure.

**The Challenge**: Build a modern, accessible design system that can coexist with the current system while addressing technical debt and infrastructure limitations.

**The Solution**: Create Spectrum 2 with a core-component architecture, modern tooling, and comprehensive accessibility standards.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

### Current State Issues

**📊 Quantified Problems**:

- **67 components** with inconsistent accessibility patterns
- **9 tools** with varying complexity and known issues
- **Testing infrastructure** 2+ versions behind with manual patches
- **No bundling strategy** - consumers must bundle themselves
- **Source-based builds** - no dist optimization
- **Complex interdependencies** - average 3.2 tool imports per component

**🔍 Specific Pain Points**:

1. **Accessibility Gaps**:

    - Inconsistent ARIA implementation across components
    - Missing keyboard navigation patterns
    - Shadow DOM accessibility challenges

2. **Infrastructure Debt**:

    - @web/test-runner 0.18.3 → 0.20.2 (2 major versions behind)
    - Playwright 1.44.0 → 1.53.1 (9 minor versions behind)
    - Manual patches for critical functionality

3. **Architecture Issues**:
    - No core/component separation
    - Tight coupling between styling and logic
    - Complex tool inheritance patterns

    - Build time improvement (target: 60% faster)
    - Runtime performance gains

### Technical Requirements

**Must Have**:

- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Open Web Components standards
- Lit-based implementation
- Comprehensive test coverage (>95%)
- Modern browser support (last 2 versions)

**Should Have**:

```

### Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
2. **Composition over Inheritance**: Build complex components from simple ones
3. **Accessibility First**: A11y built in, not bolted on
4. **Performance Conscious**: Bundle size and runtime performance considered
5. **Developer Experience**: Clear APIs, good documentation, helpful errors
