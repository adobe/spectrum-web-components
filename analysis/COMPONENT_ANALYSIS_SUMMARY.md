# Complete Component Analysis Summary

## ðŸ“Š Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of all 68 components in the Spectrum Web Components library, categorized by complexity and migration strategy requirements. The analysis has been updated to reflect interdependency cascade effects and shared tool accessibility issues.

## ðŸŽ¯ Analysis Methodology

Each component was evaluated across multiple dimensions:

- **Complexity Score**: 1-10 scale based on lines of code, dependencies, and architectural complexity
- **Accessibility Score**: Current WCAG 2.1 AA compliance level (updated to reflect tool dependencies)
- **Reusability**: How much of the current implementation can be preserved
- **Migration Strategy**: Required approach for Spectrum 2
- **Tool Dependencies**: Impact of shared tool complexity and accessibility issues

## ðŸ”§ Critical Tool Dependencies Impact

### Shared Tool Accessibility Issues

The analysis revealed that many components inherit accessibility gaps from shared tools:

- **Focusable Tool** (in Shared utilities): Affects 25+ components with missing screen reader announcements and limited focus restoration
- **Overlay System**: Affects 8+ components with complex focus management issues and accessibility gaps
- **Reactive Controllers**: Affects 10+ components with over-engineered state management affecting accessibility
- **Base System**: Foundation accessibility patterns inherited by all components

### Cascade Effect on Accessibility Ratings

Components that were initially rated as "Excellent" accessibility have been downgraded to "Fair" or "Poor" based on inherited tool issues:

- **Button, Checkbox, Radio, Switch**: Downgraded due to Focusable tool limitations
- **Action Menu, Dialog, Menu**: Downgraded due to Overlay system complexity
- **Combobox, Number Field, Picker, Textfield**: Downgraded due to multiple complex dependencies
