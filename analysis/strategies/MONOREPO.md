# Strategy 2: Monorepo Approach

## 🎯 Overview

Integrate Spectrum 2 development within the existing repository structure, creating a unified monorepo that houses both systems. This approach leverages existing infrastructure while building the new system.

### Package Naming Strategy

- **Spectrum 1**: `@spectrum-web-components/*` (unchanged)
- **Spectrum 2**: `@spectrum-2/*` (new namespace within same repo)

## ✅ Advantages

### 🔧 Infrastructure Reuse

- **Existing CI/CD**: Leverage current CircleCI setup with modifications
- **Shared tooling**: Reuse build scripts, linting, and testing infrastructure
- **Single repository**: One place for all Spectrum development
- **Shared dependencies**: Common development dependencies across both systems

### 📚 Knowledge Sharing

- **Cross-pollination**: Easy to share learnings between systems
- **Unified documentation**: Single source for all Spectrum information
- **Team collaboration**: Easier collaboration between Spectrum 1 and 2 teams
- **Consistent patterns**: Maintain consistency across both systems

### 🔄 Migration Benefits

- **Gradual transition**: Natural progression from v1 to v2 within same repo
- **Shared utilities**: Common utilities can be used by both systems
- **Unified releases**: Coordinate releases between both systems
- **Historical context**: Full git history and context preserved

## ❌ Disadvantages

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Complexity

- **Build complexity**: Need to handle two different build systems
- **CI/CD overhead**: Complex pipeline logic to handle both systems
- **Dependency conflicts**: Potential conflicts between v1 and v2 dependencies
- **Testing complexity**: Running tests for both systems increases CI time

### 🚧 Development Challenges

- **Legacy constraints**: Existing infrastructure may limit modern tooling choices
- **Merge conflicts**: Higher chance of conflicts with more active development
- **Repository size**: Larger repository with longer clone times
- **Cognitive overhead**: Developers need to understand both systems

### 🔒 Risk Factors

- **Cross-contamination**: Changes to shared infrastructure affect both systems
- **Performance impact**: CI/CD becomes slower with dual system support
- **Rollback complexity**: Harder to isolate and rollback changes
- **Tool version conflicts**: Difficulty upgrading tools used by both systems
