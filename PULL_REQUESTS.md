## Pull request creation

### Branch naming

We use a straightforward branch naming convention:

-   `[username]/[short-description]` (e.g., `alex/fix-dropdown-bug`)
-   If referencing a known issue, incorporate the issue number (e.g., `alex/123-fix-dropdown-bug`)

### Changeset requirements

For PRs that add or update a component:

-   Must include a changeset to trigger the release train and update the CHANGELOG
-   Changeset type should be one of:
    -   `patch` - for bug fixes only
    -   `minor` - for new components or new APIs in an existing component
    -   `major` - for breaking changes to a component or public library API

### Conventional commits

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification to make change tracking predictable:

Format: `type(component?): subject`

The component is optional but should reference the package you are updating.

Types include:

-   `feat`: New features or enhancements
-   `fix`: Bug fixes
-   `docs`: Documentation changes
-   `style`: Formatting, linting (not CSS changes)
-   `chore`: Build tooling, repo management, dependency updates
-   `perf`: Performance improvements
-   `test`: Adding or updating tests

Examples:

-   `feat(sp-card): add shadow styles for theme consistency`
-   `fix(sp-action-menu): correct arrow key navigation in nested menus`
-   `docs: clarify how to submit bug reports`

For breaking changes, add a `!` after the type/scope:

-   `feat(sp-button)!: change API for icon placement`

## Pull request template

When creating a pull request, you'll be presented with our template. Complete all sections to the best of your ability, including:

-   Description of the changes
-   Related issues (using proper [GitHub keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/using-keywords-in-issues-and-pull-requests#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) to auto-close issues i.e. `fixes`, `resolves`, or `closes`)
-   Type of change in the PR title (bug fix, feature, breaking change)
-   Steps you took to test your changes that reviewers can follow to also test them
-   Checklist of items completed
-   Screenshots/videos for visual changes

Incomplete templates may delay the review process.

## Labels and their meanings

-   `ready-for-review`: PR is ready for maintainer review
-   `ready-for-merge`: PR has two approvals and all tests pass. This label will keep the base of the PR up-to-date with main until it's merged.
-   `WIP`: PR is still being worked on, not ready for review
-   `blocked`: PR is blocked for some reason i.e. another PR needs to go in first
-   `needs-tests`: PR is missing necessary tests
-   `needs-docs`: PR requires documentation updates
-   `needs-self-review`: PR requires that the author does a self-review of code to answer preliminary questions
-   `needs-style-review`: PR needs to be checked by a CSS expert
-   `needs-design-review`: PR needs to be checked by the Spectrum Design team
-   `breaking-change`: PR contains changes that break backward compatibility
-   `help-wanted`: Extra attention is needed on this PR
-   `on-hold`: PR needs more discussion.
-   `Spectrum CSS`: An issue or pull request specific to the CSS being used by components.
-   `Component: [Name]`: PR effects this component
-   `auto-update`: Keep the base of the PR up-to-date with main automatically if there are no conflicts.

Apply labels promptly to help maintainers prioritize and manage the review queue.

## Pull request review process

### Review timing

-   Maintainers aim to review PRs in a timely manner
-   If your PR hasn't received attention, feel free to ping the team in the PR comments

### Review expectations

Reviewers will check for:

-   Adherence to code style and component patterns
-   Proper test coverage
-   Documentation completeness
-   Accessibility compliance
-   Visual regression test coverage
-   Performance considerations

### Review etiquette

Pull requests are the start of a conversation. During the process, we aim to provide feedback that is constructive, respectful, and actionable. Suggestions will be focused on team coding standards but not on an individual's coding preferences unless there are specific considerations or risks in one approach over another.

Both reviewers and PR authors should follow these guidelines:

#### For reviewers

-   **Maintain momentum**: Complete reviews in a timely manner to keep the project moving forward.
-   **Provide clear, actionable feedback**: Help contributors succeed by offering specific guidance and explaining the reasoning behind suggested changes.
-   **Offer solutions**: When identifying areas for improvement, suggest alternative approaches and use code suggestions to make implementation easier.
-   **Seek understanding**: Ask questions to clarify intent and approach, fostering a collaborative environment for learning and improvement.
-   **Recognize excellence**: Celebrate well-written code and thoughtful design decisions to encourage continued high-quality contributions.
-   **Focus on impact**: Prioritize feedback on architecture, functionality, and performance to ensure the most important aspects are addressed first.
-   **Focus on value**: Prioritize feedback that improves code quality and maintainability over personal style preferences. If you make a suggestion that is non-blocking feedback, prepend the comment with `nit:`.
-   **Consider context**: Tailor feedback to the PR author's experience level and the scope of changes.
-   **Use changes requested thoughtfully**: Reserve the Changes Requested status for instances where critical issues need to be addressed.
-   **Review VRTs with care**: Thoroughly examine visual regression test results and communicate approval status to authors.

#### For PR authors

-   **Self review your PR**: Authors should take a first pass as reviewing and commenting on their submission. This provides reviewers faster context for the thinking that went in to the code and preemptively answer questions they may have.
-   **Be receptive to feedback**: Approach review comments with an open mind. The goal is better code, not personal criticism.
-   **Resolve/respond to all comments**: Address each review comment, either with code changes or explanations of your approach.
-   **Ask for clarification**: If review feedback is unclear, ask questions to understand the concern.
-   **Notify when ready**: After addressing feedback, notify reviewers that the PR is ready for another look either in Slack or by requesting a new review in GitHub.
-   **Explain complex changes**: For non-obvious changes, explain your reasoning in the PR description or comments.
-   **Break down large PRs**: When possible, split large changes into smaller, more manageable PRs.
-   **Test thoroughly**: Before requesting review, ensure your code meets the project's quality standards.

#### Resolving disagreements

-   **Focus on data**: Back up opinions with data, documentation, or examples where possible.
-   **Refer to standards**: Use project conventions and industry best practices to guide decisions.
-   **Compromise when appropriate**: Be willing to find middle ground when opinions differ.
-   **Escalate respectfully**: If consensus can't be reached, involve a third team member or technical lead for guidance.
-   **Document decisions**: Record the reasoning behind significant technical decisions for future reference.

Remember that code reviews are a collaborative process aimed at improving code quality, knowledge sharing, and maintaining project standards. Approaching reviews with empathy and professionalism benefits everyone involved.
