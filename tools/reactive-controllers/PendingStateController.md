## Description

The `PendingStateController` is a class that helps manage the pending state of a reactive element. It provides a standardized way to indicate when an element is in a pending state, such as during an asynchronous operation.
When the components is in a pending state it supplies the pending state UI `sp-progress-circle` which gets rendered in the component.
It also updates the value of ARIA label of the host element to its pending-label based on the pending state.

The `HostWithPendingState` interface defines the properties that a host element must implement to work with the `PendingStateController`.

import { LitElement } from 'lit';
import { PendingStateController } from '@spectrum-web-components/reactive-controllers/src/PendingState.js';
class Host extends LitElement{

    /** Whether the items are currently loading. */
    @property({ type: Boolean, reflect: true })
    public pending = false;

    /** Defines a string value that labels the Picker while it is in pending state. */
    @property({ type: String, attribute: 'pending-label' })
    public pendingLabel = 'Pending';
    public pendingStateController: PendingStateController<this>;

        ${when(
                this.pending,
                () => {
                    return this.pendingStateController.renderPendingState();
                }
