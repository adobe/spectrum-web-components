# Strategy 1: New Repository Approach

## 🎯 Overview

Create a completely new GitHub repository for Spectrum 2, allowing both systems to coexist independently. This approach provides the cleanest separation and fastest development velocity.

```

### Package Naming Strategy

- **Spectrum 1**: `@spectrum-web-components/*` (unchanged)
- **Spectrum 2**: `@spectrum-2/*` (new namespace)

## ✅ Advantages

### 🚀 Development Velocity

- **No legacy constraints**: Build with modern patterns from day one
- **Parallel development**: Teams can work simultaneously without conflicts
- **Clean architecture**: No need to work around existing technical debt
- **Modern tooling**: Latest versions of all tools without compatibility concerns

### 🔒 Risk Mitigation

- **Zero impact on Spectrum 1**: No risk of breaking existing implementations
- **Independent releases**: Separate release cycles and versioning
- **Rollback capability**: Easy to revert if needed
- **Isolated testing**: No cross-contamination of test suites

### 🏗️ Architecture Benefits

- **Greenfield development**: Implement best practices without compromise
- **Core-first design**: Build shared functionality before components
- **Bundle optimization**: Design for optimal bundle sizes from start
- **Accessibility first**: Built-in a11y patterns, not retrofitted

### 🔄 Coexistence Excellence

- **Side-by-side usage**: Both systems can run in same application
- **Gradual migration**: Teams can migrate component by component
- **No namespace conflicts**: Different package names prevent conflicts
- **Independent styling**: No CSS conflicts between systems

## ❌ Disadvantages

### 📈 Initial Overhead

- **Repository setup**: 2-3 weeks to establish new repo infrastructure
- **CI/CD configuration**: Need to set up entire pipeline from scratch
- **Documentation site**: New Storybook and documentation setup required
- **Team onboarding**: Learning new repository structure and processes

### 🔧 Maintenance Considerations

- **Dual maintenance**: Need to maintain both systems during transition
- **Knowledge sharing**: Learnings from Spectrum 2 need manual backporting
- **Resource allocation**: Team split between two codebases
- **Tooling duplication**: Some tooling setup duplicated across repos

### 📦 Package Management

- **Dependency management**: Two separate dependency trees to maintain
- **Version alignment**: Ensuring compatible versions across systems
- **Bundle analysis**: Need separate tooling for each system
- **Security updates**: Updates needed in both repositories
