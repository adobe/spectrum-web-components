# Strategy 3: Branching Approach

## 🎯 Overview

Develop Spectrum 2 in a long-lived feature branch within the existing repository, eventually merging or replacing the main branch. This approach maintains repository continuity while building the new system.

## 📊 Strategy Details

### Branch Structure

```
spectrum-web-components/
├── main (Spectrum 1)
│   ├── packages/
│   ├── tools/
│   └── ...
└── spectrum-2-development (Long-lived branch)
    ├── packages/
    │   ├── core/                # @spectrum-2/core
    │   ├── components/          # @spectrum-2/components
    │   └── styles/              # @spectrum-2/styles
    ├── tools/
    └── ...
```

### Package Naming Strategy

- **During Development**: Same structure, different branch
- **After Merge**: Replace existing packages or dual namespace

## ✅ Advantages

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Continuity

- **Existing setup**: Use current CI/CD with branch-specific configurations
- **Repository history**: Maintain complete git history and context
- **Familiar workflow**: Team familiar with existing repository structure
- **Gradual transition**: Natural progression from current to new system

### 💰 Cost Efficiency

- **No duplication**: Single repository, single CI/CD setup
- **Shared resources**: Utilize existing infrastructure investments
- **Minimal setup**: Fastest initial setup time
- **Unified management**: Single place for all development

### 🔄 Simplified Management

- **Single repository**: One place for issues, PRs, and documentation
- **Unified releases**: Coordinate releases from single repository
- **Shared team**: Same team working on both versions
- **Knowledge continuity**: Natural knowledge transfer between versions

## ❌ Disadvantages

### 🚧 Development Constraints

- **Branch conflicts**: Potential for complex merge conflicts
- **Limited experimentation**: Harder to experiment with radical changes
- **CI/CD limitations**: Current infrastructure may limit modern tooling
- **Legacy dependencies**: Constrained by existing dependency choices

### 🔒 High Risk Profile

- **Merge complexity**: Complex merge when ready to replace main
- **Rollback difficulty**: Hard to rollback after major changes
- **Development velocity**: Slower development due to constraints
- **Testing isolation**: Harder to isolate testing between versions

### ⚡ Performance Issues

- **Branch size**: Large long-lived branch becomes unwieldy
- **CI/CD overhead**: Running tests for both branches increases load
- **Merge conflicts**: Frequent conflicts slow down development
- **Repository bloat**: Repository becomes large with dual development

### 🤝 Coexistence Challenges

- **Package conflicts**: Same package names cause conflicts
- **Deployment complexity**: Harder to deploy both versions simultaneously
- **Version management**: Complex versioning during transition period
- **Consumer confusion**: Unclear which version consumers should use

## 📊 Comparison with Other Strategies

| Aspect                | New Repository | Monorepo | Branching  |
| --------------------- | -------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| **Setup Speed**       | ⭐⭐⭐         | ⭐⭐     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Development Speed** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐     | ⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐       |
| **Risk Level**        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐     | ⭐⭐     | ⭐         |
| **Merge Complexity**  | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐     | ⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐         |
| **Coexistence**       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐       |

**Recommendation**: ❌ **Not Recommended**

This strategy has the highest risk profile with complex merge challenges, slower development velocity, and poor coexistence capabilities. The initial setup speed advantage is quickly offset by ongoing complexity.

## 🚨 Critical Concerns

### Merge Complexity

The final merge will be extremely complex with potential for:

- Thousands of merge conflicts
- Weeks of resolution time
- High risk of introducing bugs
- Potential need for complete restart

### Development Velocity

Long-lived branches typically result in:

- 30-50% slower development
- Significant time spent on conflict resolution
- Reduced ability to experiment
- Team frustration and burnout

### Coexistence Challenges

This approach makes it very difficult to:

- Run both systems simultaneously
- Gradually migrate components
- Rollback individual components
- Maintain both systems during transition

**Conclusion**: While this approach has the fastest initial setup, the long-term costs and risks make it unsuitable for a project of this scope and importance.
